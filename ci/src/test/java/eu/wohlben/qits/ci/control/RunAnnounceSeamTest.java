/**
 * The {@link RunAnnouncer} seam's semantics: exactly one announcement per finished run that says
 * something true about its commit — the green kind for a green run, the failure kind (with the
 * terminal status's own word) for a red run or a config error — and <b>nothing</b> for a cancelled
 * one.
 *
 * <p>It is the whole of what a green run announces. There was a second port beside it —
 * {@code PdNotifier}, a direct POST to qits-platform-deployments' intake — and this file used to say
 * so; the deployer subscribes off the bus now (to {@code SoftwareRelease}, since a green build is no
 * longer a reason to deploy), so there is nothing left to be a sibling of. What hangs off this
 * announcement is qits-projects' release-request gate.
 *
 * <p>The assertion worth naming is {@code finishedAt}: the wire contract
 * requires an {@code occurredAt} on every published event, so a null here would be a 400 from
 * qits-events on every single green build, discovered in a deployment rather than in a suite. It has
 * to be the timestamp on the run's own row — what the announcement says happened is the run
 * finishing, not the announcement being made.
 *
 * <p>What the production implementation does with the announcement (build a {@code BuildSuccessful}
 * or {@code BuildFailed}, hand it to the bus, land a PUT) is {@code BuildSuccessfulPublishTest}'s
 * job in the service module.
