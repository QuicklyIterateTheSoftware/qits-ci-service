/**
 * <b>What the schema looks like once the lineage has run, against the engine it ships on.</b> The
 * migration is applied to a real PostgreSQL (see {@code testdb/EmbeddedPg}), so what is asserted
 * here is the shipped {@code V1__init.sql} rather than a description of it.
 *
 * <p>It exists because the check constraints are a set of DECISIONS, each argued in that file's
 * header, and postgres would permit every one of them. Two of those decisions used to be
 * self-enforcing: the H2 lineage removed the enum checks in V5 and in a java V9 that read
 * INFORMATION_SCHEMA, because H2 2.4.240 tied a compiled IN-set to the session that made it and
 * failed valid writes with 23514 — on a freshly bootstrapped platform that killed every run,
 * step-less. That defect is gone with H2 and with the migrations that answered it, and what remains
 * is a choice nothing in the code would notice being reversed. So it is pinned.
 *
 * <p>Read out of {@code pg_constraint} and not {@code information_schema.table_constraints}: postgres
 * lists a NOT NULL as a CHECK row there, so "no check constraints" would be unassertable through the
 * standard view. {@code contype = 'c'} is the real question.
