/**
 * The two machine-guarded things a release request can have done to its CI: <b>withdraw</b> it, and
 * <b>re-ask</b> it.
 *
 * <p>Both exist because {@code ci_run.release_request_id} does. The commit those runs build is a
 * fold nobody pushed — the tip of {@code release/<id>}, rewritten by the next re-fold — so neither
 * qits-projects nor an operator has a sha that stays true or a run id that survives. The request id
 * is the handle, and these are the two operations that hold it.
 *
 * <p>Three properties are the point of the file, and each one is a way the feature could be quietly
 * wrong:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>a cancellation is scoped to one request in one repository</b> — a sibling request open
 *       against the same repository must keep building, or withdrawing one request takes down work
 *       nobody withdrew;
 *   <li><b>a cancelled run publishes no verdict at all</b> — the release gate on the other side
 *       reads {@code BuildFailed} as "this commit is not releasable", and a withdrawn question
 *       answered that way would hold a commit for a build somebody stopped on purpose;
 *   <li><b>a retry is a second run of the same work</b>, past the dedupe that exists to refuse
 *       exactly that shape, and carrying the same request id, the same sha and the same cause — so
 *       its verdict correlates as if the first run had gone the other way.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Queued states are staged against a <b>genuinely occupied worker</b>, {@code CiQueuedRunTest}'s
 * arrangement: the run worker is single-threaded, so parking one run inside its first step is what
 * makes the next ones queue, at an instant the test controls rather than one it hopes to catch.
