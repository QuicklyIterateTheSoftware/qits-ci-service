/**
 * The {@link CiConfigSource} for the ci suite: an in-memory catalogue of trigger files per (repoId,
 * branch, scope), plus per-commit answers to the commit-held probe.
 *
 * <p><b>It used to carry a third thing and the push arm took it with it.</b> {@code read(repo,
 * branch, sha)} answered a whole {@code ConfigLookup} — FOUND with content, ABSENT, GONE,
 * UNREACHABLE, INVALID — because the push path read a pipeline out of a commit on the run worker.
 * Nothing reads a pipeline out of a commit any more: a trigger file is read at a branch head by
 * {@code CiEventTriggerService}, and the only per-commit question left is whether the repository
 * still holds the sha a step container failed to check out.
 *
 * <p>So a commit is {@link CommitHeld#HELD} unless a test says otherwise, which is the interesting
 * default rather than a neutral one: it is what a healthy git host answers, and staging a discard
 * therefore has to be deliberate.
