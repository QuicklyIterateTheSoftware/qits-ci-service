-- The whole schema of qits-ci, in one migration.
--
-- ONE V1 AND NO INHERITED LINEAGE. The H2 lineage (V1-V8 plus the java V9) is deleted rather than
-- continued, and the move off H2 is what allowed it: this context's store becomes a postgres
-- database provisioned by the deployment spec's `resources:` line, reached by re-bootstrap rather
-- than by a data migration, so no postgres database anywhere has ever run those files and no
-- `V10__move_to_postgres.sql` had a reader. Their content is history in this repository's log; the
-- shape below is where the nine of them ARRIVED, translated. FROM HERE ON THE ORDINARY RULE IS
-- BACK: keep appending, never edit an applied migration.
--
-- What the H2 lineage cost, and what the translation therefore does NOT reproduce:
--   * V2/V3/V6/V7's `alter table add column` steps are folded into the create statements, with no
--     backfill and no add-default-then-drop dance, because every database reaching this file is
--     empty. `trigger_type` and `config_path` are plainly `not null` here; V3 had to arrive at that
--     through a default it then dropped.
--   * V4's probe row is gone. It inserted and deleted one QUEUED run to prove a generated
--     constraint had really been dropped — a check on the migration ABOVE it, not on this schema.
--   * `clob` becomes `text` (see the entity note below), and every timestamp is
--     `timestamp(6) with time zone`, which postgres reads as its own timestamptz. V6's three
--     columns said `timestamp with time zone` without the precision; they are spelled like their
--     siblings here, and postgres' default precision is 6 either way.
--
-- CHECK CONSTRAINTS, DECIDED ONE AT A TIME rather than by a rule, because postgres would now permit
-- every one of them:
--   * ci_run.status, ci_run.trigger_type, ci_step.status — NOT RECREATED. V5 and V9 removed them
--     from H2 because H2 2.4.240 tied a compiled IN-set to the session that made it and failed
--     valid writes with 23514 once the pool retired that session; on a freshly bootstrapped
--     platform that killed every run, step-less. Postgres has no such defect, so the H2 reason has
--     lapsed and the OTHER reason is what stands: these are catalogues that grow. `status` was
--     widened once already (V4 added QUEUED) and `trigger_type` gained EVENT after POST_RECEIVE, so
--     a database enumerating them would be a second list to keep in step with CiRunStatus,
--     CiTriggerType and CiStepStatus — which are @Enumerated(STRING) and are what every write goes
--     through. Same conclusion, and the same wording, as qits-platform-deployments' own V1.
--   * ci_daemon_pin.verdict — KEPT, and it is the one that reads the other way, exactly as the
--     eventstream outbox's `status` check does. V8 declared it NAMED and V9 deliberately left it
--     alone rather than sweeping it up. A verdict is a closed statement about one probe's outcome
--     with an UNKNOWN arm already in it, so it is an invariant rather than a growing catalogue; and
--     being named, the day it ever needs widening costs one line of SQL with nothing to measure.
--     That is precisely what V1's two anonymous inline checks could not offer, and why they became
--     a java migration reading INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
--
-- No column here holds another context's key: repo_id, trigger_event_id and superseded_by_run_id are
-- plain strings. The one FK is inside this context's own database, which the cross-context rule
-- permits.

-- a domain event matching one of the repository's .config/qits/ci-event-<name>.yml files. The row is
-- born at ACCEPT time carrying QUEUED and the worker flips it to RUNNING, so a queued run is
-- visible on every read surface and survives the process.

-- follows it, and plain `unique` is therefore right — `nulls not distinct`, which postgres 15 added
-- and this engine has, is exactly what must NOT be asked for here. Verified by a test rather than
-- believed — see CiEventTriggerDedupeTest — because it is the one line here whose failure mode is
