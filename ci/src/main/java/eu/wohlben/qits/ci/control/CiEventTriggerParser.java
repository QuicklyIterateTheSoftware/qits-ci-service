/**
 * Parses a repo-committed {@code .config/qits/ci-event-*.yml}: the pipeline schema ({@link
 * CiConfigSchema}) plus the two keys that make it a trigger — {@code event:}, the exact envelope name, and {@code when:}, the selection — and the
 * optional {@code artifacts:} declaration of what the pipeline publishes.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * event: BuildSuccessful
 * when:
 *   - repoId: { exact: qits-spa-ui-components }
 *     branch: { exact: main }
 * steps:
 *   - image: qits/build-images/node-base:latest
 *     script: ./bump-and-push.sh
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>{@code repoId:} names the repository's ADDRESSABLE NAME</h2>
 *
 * <p>The matcher above reads as "the repository this event is about", and after the repository
 * identity campaign that is the repository's <b>name</b> — the second half of the one public address
 * {@code /git/<projectId>/<repoName>}. An {@code SCM*} event carries {@code repoName} filled from
 * the address the push arrived on, and a condition on {@code repoId} is evaluated against it
 * whenever it is there.
 *
 * <p><b>The id is the legacy fallback.</b> An event with no {@code repoName} — a push on the
 * internal id-addressed route, and every event published before the campaign — is matched against
 * its {@code repoId} exactly as it always was. That is what keeps the estate's existing files
 * working unedited on both sides of the cutover: before it the storage id and the name agree, and
 * after it the name field answers. The key keeps its spelling deliberately, because renaming it
 * would break every one of those files to say something they already mean. The alias itself is
 * {@code CiEventSelectionEvaluator.resolveAddressable}, applied at evaluation rather than here,
 * since whether the fallback applies is a property of the arriving event and not of the file.
 *
 * <p>A <b>release pipeline</b> is the same file with the fourth key: it selects an {@code SCMRelease}
 * naming its own repository, checks out the released tag, publishes — and declares what it published,
 * so that a green run announces one {@code SoftwareRelease} per artifact. See {@link CiArtifact}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * event: SCMRelease
 * when:
 *   - repository: { exact: qits-spa-ui-components }
 * artifacts:
 *   - { type: npm, name: "@qits/ui-components" }
 * steps:
 *   - image: qits/build-images/node-base:latest
 *     script: ./publish-tag.sh
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>{@code event:} is mandatory, and the missing-key failure is loud</h2>
 *
 * <p>A {@code ci-event-*.yml} <b>without</b> {@code event:} is a parse error rather than a file that
 * matches nothing. Neither mistake is allowed to be silent — a trigger that cannot be parsed must not
 * quietly never fire, which is indistinguishable from a selection that never matched.
 *
 * <p>This used to be half of a <b>two-way rule</b>, and the other half went with per-push CI on
 * 2026-09-05: {@code event:}, {@code when:}, {@code artifacts:} and {@code checkout:} were parse
 * errors in {@code ci-post-receive.yml}, so a selection written into the wrong file could not be
 * mistaken for a trigger that never matched. There is no other file left for a declaration to be in.
 *
 * <h2>Strict about unknown top-level keys, and that is deliberate</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code event}, {@code when}, {@code steps}, {@code checkout} and {@code artifacts} are the whole
 * vocabulary and anything else is an error — unlike the step list below, and unlike the retired push
 * pipeline, which ignored unknown top-level keys so a repository could carry config for a newer
 * qits-ci. The reason is what an unknown key <em>costs</em>. In a pipeline, an unread key costs a
 * feature that was not there yet. In a <b>selection</b>, it costs <em>correctness</em> — a mistyped
 * {@code wehn:} would parse as "no selection", and an absent {@code when} means <b>unconditional</b>,
 * so the trigger would fire on every event of that name instead of the two the repository meant.
 * Silently widening a selection is the one failure mode this file cannot have.
 *
 * <p>The step list keeps its own leniency, because a step schema that refused unknown keys would
 * turn every forward-compatible pipeline into a parse error. <b>The one key it subtracts is {@code
 * branches:}</b>, and subtracting is still the point now that {@code checkout:} can name a branch:
 * the run's branch is the trigger's single decision — resolved once, from the payload, before any
 * step exists — so a per-step filter over it is either inert decoration or a step that can never
 * run, and a condition over the event's branch is what {@code when:} already spells. See {@link
 * CiConfigSchema#steps}.
 *
 * <h2>Failures are per file</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every problem here is a {@link CiConfigException} naming the file. The engine catches it, warns
 * with the repository and the path, and moves on to the repository's <em>other</em> trigger files: one
 * broken selection never disables the ones beside it.

   *
   * <p>{@code gating:} was removed as a concept (ticket 9441bc6e, and see {@link
   * CiConfigSchema#REFUSED_GATING_KEY} for what it cost): every step of a pipeline gates, a failing
   * step fails the run, and a run's verdict is its outcome. Making the key a <b>parse error</b> is
   * the whole of how it stays removed — the 2026-09-07 retirement of the same flag deleted the
   * declarations and left the documents prescribing it, and it came back within days.
   *
   * <p>But a parse error on a trigger document is not one thing, because this parser serves two
   * kinds of caller. On the <b>file-read path</b> a refusal is a repository being told to fix a line
   * it committed, which is exactly right. On the <b>snapshot-replay path</b> the text is not a file
   * anybody can fix: {@code CiRunService.reconstructEventRun} re-parses it to rebuild a run that was
   * <em>already accepted</em>, and {@code predictFromHistory} parses it to predict step durations.
   * Neither catches a parse failure, and neither has anything to offer a repository. A single strict
   * parser would therefore have killed every run queued across the deploy that ships this change,
   * and every retry of a historical run whose stored snapshot still carries the key — punishing runs
   * for a declaration that was legal when they were accepted.
   *
   * <p><b>The tolerant path drains to empty on its own, and nothing refills it.</b> A snapshot is
   * written from a document that came through {@link #parse}, so once the composer stops emitting
   * the key and the strict path refuses it, no NEW snapshot can carry it. What is left is a finite,
   * shrinking set of rows accepted before this deploy. The strict path is the only way in, which is
   * what makes the leniency here a migration and not a second, quieter version of the feature: this
   * branch cannot make a run non-gating, because there is no such thing to be any more. It reads a
