/**
 * The port {@link ReleaseJoin} announces a <b>published artifact</b> through — the second seam the
 * event bus hangs off, beside {@link RunAnnouncer} and deliberately not the same one.
 *
 * <p><b>The caller is the join and no longer the run.</b> {@link CiRunService} used to call this
 * directly from a green run; it now hands what the run published to {@link ReleaseJoin}, which calls
 * this only once an {@code SCMRelease} for the same {@code (repository, version)} has been seen. A
 * bootstrap replay restores a tag, builds green and reaches this port never. Nothing about the
 * signature or the semantics of one call changed with that move.
 *
 * <p>The two are separate because they say different things about the same green run.
 * {@code RunAnnouncer} says <em>a build passed</em>, once, for every green run there has ever been.
 * This one says <em>this exact package is in qits-artifacts and you can install it</em>, once per
 * artifact the trigger file declared, and only for a release pipeline. Folding them into one port
 * would put "the run finished" and "the registry has it" behind one name, which is precisely the
 * conflation the whole redesign exists to undo: the previous single event fired at release-push time
 * and was read as "the package exists", and the gap between those two moments is an upstream build.
 *
 * <p><b>Fan-out is the caller's, and the port takes one artifact.</b> N declarations are N calls, so
 * a partial failure costs one announcement rather than the rest, and nothing here has to know that
 * the events are siblings. The bus side already supports the shape — the outbox enqueues one row per
 * event in its own transaction and {@code CausationScope.current()} is a non-consuming read.
 *
 * <p>An interface rather than a call so this module stays free of the bus and its transport; the
 * sole production implementation is {@code service/…/bus/SoftwareReleaseAnnouncer}, and zero
 * implementations is a supported configuration. <b>The same must-not-block rule as
 * {@link RunAnnouncer}</b>, with the same reason and one sharper edge: this runs on the
 * run worker or on the bus's dispatch thread, a release pipeline may declare several artifacts, and
 * the join holds the owed rows locked across the calls — so an unreachable qits-events costs the
 * publish timeout <em>per artifact</em>.

  /**
   * A release pipeline went green and this artifact is published.
   *
   * @param runId the run that published it. <b>Not on the wire</b> — the event names the artifact,
   *     and a consumer installing a package has no business with a CI run id — but an announcement
   *     that goes wrong has to be traceable to the run it came from.
   * @param repoId the repository whose pipeline published it — this repo, not the upstream that
   *     triggered it
   * @param projectId the project that repository belongs to, as qits-projects names it, so a consumer
   *     can address the repository without a lookup of its own. <b>Null</b> where the run carries no
   *     public coordinate (an id-addressed candidate, and every row recorded before the identity
   *     campaign); absent is a supported value and must never be invented into one
   * @param repoName the repository's public name, the other half of that address — a consumer reads a
   *     released repository's files at {@code /git/<projectId>/<repoName>/…}, and the id-addressed
   *     scheme it would otherwise fall back to is refused to everyone but qits-projects. <b>Null</b>
   *     on exactly the runs {@code projectId} is null on, and for the same reason
   * @param version the version, read out of the triggering event's payload — {@code version} on an
   *     {@code SCMRelease}, {@code tagName} on an {@code SCMPublishTag}. qits-ci publishes nothing
   *     when neither is there: the declaration was written for a trigger that cannot feed it.
   * @param packageType {@code npm}, {@code maven}, {@code docker} or {@code daemon} — {@link
   *     CiArtifact.Type#declared()}, the keyword the trigger file used, which is also the wire value
   * @param packageName the exact package name, unqualified for docker ({@code qits/qits-stt}): no
   *     registry-qualified reference is portable across the step network and this process's own
   * @param finishedAt the run's terminal timestamp, which is when the artifact became available
   * @param triggerEventId the event that caused this run, stamped as the published event's parent —
   *     a plain String for the reason {@link RunAnnouncer} argues in full. Never null in practice:
   *     only an event-triggered run can carry a declaration.
   * @param priority the priority the release itself stated, read off the recorded {@code SCMRelease}
   *     fact by {@link ReleaseJoin} and passed through <b>verbatim</b>. qits-ci acts on it nowhere —
   *     it orders no queue by it, compares it to nothing and has no enum for it, because the
   *     vocabulary is qits-projects' and a second copy of it here would be a second list to keep in
   *     step. <b>Null</b> whenever no release fact stands behind the announcement: a run whose
   *     trigger WAS the release (the manual door, a hand-supplied event, which rides no bus and
   *     leaves no row), a release announced before the field existed, and a replay. Absent is a
   *     supported value and reaches the wire as a missing key.
