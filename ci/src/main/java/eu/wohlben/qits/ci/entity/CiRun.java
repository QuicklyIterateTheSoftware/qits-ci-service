/**
 * One CI pipeline execution: one domain event matched one repository's {@code
 * .config/qits/ci-event-*.yml}, and this is the row that pipeline ran under. (Rows recorded before
 * 2026-09-05 may instead be one (push, updated branch ref) whose commit carried {@code
 * .config/qits/ci-post-receive.yml} — that intake retired, its rows did not.) {@link #repoId} is a
 * plain string — ci lives in its own
 * physical DB with NO FK into qits' tables (a deleted repository leaves runs behind as dangling
 * history, the artifacts stance). Steps are {@link CiStep} rows keyed by {@link CiStep#runId}, not
 * a JPA relation.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}, beside its own richer record.</b> {@link #causationId} is the
 * platform's generic trace column, and it is filled two ways because the two accept paths stand on
 * different threads. A bus-arrived event crosses the trigger queue before the row is written, and
 * an executor hop is exactly where the ambient {@code CausationScope} dies — so {@code
 * CiRunService.acceptEventRun} sets the cause <em>explicitly</em> from the event id, the same way
 * every other provenance column crosses that hop, and the {@code CausationStamp} listener yields to
 * the set value. A manual trigger evaluates on the request thread, where the REST filter's restored
 * scope still stands — there the stamp itself fills the column, from the {@code
 * X-Qits-Causation-Id} the caller sent. {@link #triggerEventId} stays what it is: domain data with
 * a unique constraint on it. For an event run the two agree; a historical post-receive run has
 * neither; a manual trigger over REST records a cause where {@code triggerEventId} records none.
