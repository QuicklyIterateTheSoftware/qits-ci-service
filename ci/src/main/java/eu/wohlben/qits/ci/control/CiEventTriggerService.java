/**
 * The trigger engine: one arriving domain event → which repositories declare a pipeline for it →
 * enqueue the runs.
 *
 * <p>It sits behind the bus rather than in it. The raw-listener bean that receives frames is {@code
 * service/…/bus/CiEventTriggerListener}, and it hands one over as an {@link Arrival} — a record of
 * four strings — so this module keeps knowing nothing about {@code eu.wohlben.qits.eventstream},
 * exactly as {@link RunAnnouncer} keeps it from knowing about the publishing half.
 *
 * <h2>The executor, and why it is not the dispatch thread and not the run worker</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Not the dispatch thread.</b> {@code onFrame} runs on the bus's websocket worker, one frame at
 * a time for the whole subscription. Evaluation reads the git host <em>per candidate repository</em>,
 * so doing it inline would hold up every other consumer's frames for however long a git host takes —
 * and the typed {@code BuildSuccessfulListener} is on that same thread.
 *
 * <p><b>Not {@code ci-run-worker} either</b>, though it is the obvious reuse. That thread is occupied
 * by a running pipeline for minutes at a time; queueing evaluation behind it would mean an event that
 * arrived during a long build gets evaluated when the build ends, against a {@code main} that has
 * moved since. Evaluation-before-enqueue is a different latency class from run execution and gets its
 * own thread.
 *
 * <p><b>Single-threaded, though.</b> It was once a correctness rule — two evaluations of one
 * repository raced for the same bare cache on disk — and the caches are gone, so what is left is a
 * budget: one evaluation reads the git host once per candidate repository, and a thread per arriving
 * frame would point that fan-out at the host all at once. It matches the run worker's own shape.
 *
 * <p>The queue is <b>bounded</b>. An unbounded one turns a burst on the bus into heap; a bounded one
 * turns it into a WARN naming the event that was dropped, which is a thing a person can act on. At
 * {@link #QUEUE_CAPACITY} deep that is a backlog no healthy platform reaches.
 *
 * <h2>The manual trigger does not use that worker at all, and the reason was measured</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #evaluateNow} evaluates on the <b>caller's own thread</b> and answers what it did. Every
 * other way in is redeliverable — a bus frame that is not evaluated stays owed and the next catch-up
 * sweep offers it again — and a caller-supplied event is not: it is on no log, has no claim row and
 * nothing anywhere will ever offer it a second time. So for that one caller, "handed to a queue" and
 * "lost" are the same outcome, and the 2026-08-10 bootstrap measured it: an accepted trigger whose
 * evaluation never happened, answered 2xx, never run, with no line at any level to say so.
 *
 * <p>Two things could produce that and this closes both. The queue can be full, which {@link
 * #onEvent} reports as {@code false} — a signal the endpoint discarded. And the single worker can be
 * slow or stuck inside a git-host read, which nothing reports at all: the task simply waits in the
 * queue. Neither can reach a caller that runs the evaluation itself.
 *
 * <p><b>The cost is stated rather than hidden.</b> "One git-host fan-out at a time" is now a
 * statement about bus traffic only; a manual call fans out beside the worker. That is the right way
 * round — the budget exists to keep a burst of machine events from storming the git host, and a
 * manual trigger is one request from one person, already bounded by the HTTP worker pool.
 *
 * <h2>An accepted event is DURABLE, and that is what the enqueue used to cost</h2>
 *
 * <p>The residual window this class used to state plainly — "the claim commits when the event is
 * ACCEPTED, not when the run row exists; a crash in the gap loses that event" — is <b>closed</b>.
 * It was measured on 2026-09-04: three release requests created within a second of a qits-ci
 * redeploy were consumed without effect, their {@code ReleaseRequestChanged} claimed by the dying
 * instance and their QA runs never recorded, and with the release gate strictly requiring verdicts
 * they hung PENDING until they were withdrawn and recreated. Milliseconds are exactly as wide as a
 * cutover chooses to make them.
 *
 * <p>{@link #onEvent} now writes a {@link CiOwedEvent} row on ci's own datasource, in its own
 * transaction, <b>before</b> it reports the acceptance — and {@link #evaluateQuietly} deletes it the
 * moment the evaluation returns. The claim cannot join that transaction (it lives on the eventstream
 * datasource, and one JTA transaction does not take both), so what is made atomic is the pair that
 * can be: the acceptance is durable before it is claimable.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>dying before the row commits: the accept answers {@code false}, the listener throws, the
 *       claim rolls back and the bus offers the event again — the existing retryable path.
 *   <li>dying after it and before the run row: the claim stands, and the row is the record that the
 *       event was never evaluated. {@link #sweepOwed} re-evaluates it at boot and on a schedule.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Re-evaluating is safe by construction rather than by care</b>: {@code unique
 * (trigger_event_id, repo_id, config_path)} makes a second evaluation of an event that already
 * recorded its runs a no-op. That constraint is what lets this ledger be at-least-once.
 *
 * <p><b>What the ledger does NOT do is retry an evaluation that happened.</b> A sweep settles a row
 * whenever the evaluation returns, including one that reached no readable repository — that case is
 * the git host's, it behaves exactly as a live frame's evaluation does, and making it retryable here
 * would keep rows for a platform that simply has no candidates yet. Only a <em>throw</em> leaves the
 * row owed.
 *
 * <h2>Platform pipelines</h2>
 *
 * <p>There is a <b>second source of trigger files</b>: {@code .config/qits/ci-platform-event-*.yml}
 * in the one repository {@code qits.ci.platform-pipelines-repository} names, at its {@code main}
 * head. Such a file is parsed and selected exactly like a repository's own — same grammar, same
 * schema, same per-file containment — but the run it records is about the repository the
 * <b>payload</b> names, so one file serves the whole catalogue. See {@link #evaluatePlatform}.
 *
 * <p>It costs <b>one</b> extra listing per arriving event and no extra read per candidate: the head
 * a platform run is recorded at is the one the candidate loop already resolved for that repository.
 * A blank config key means the feature is off and nothing is read at all.

   * <p><b>On its own thread</b>, {@code ReleaseJoin.onStart}'s rule: a startup observer that blocks
   * on the network loses the container healthcheck's race and cd kills the deployment. This one
   * reads the git host once per candidate per row.
   *
   * <p><b>At {@code CiRunService.BOOT_SWEEP_PRIORITY}</b> rather than unordered, because it can
   * record runs and hand them to the run worker: it must not precede {@code

   * one the previous life left. Sharing the run sweep's rung is enough for that — the reap's is
