/**
 * One parsed {@code .config/qits/ci-event-*.yml}: the event name it listens for, the selection over
 * that event's payload, the pipeline to run when both hold, and what that pipeline publishes.
 *
 * <p>{@code artifacts} is empty for every trigger file that declares none, which is most of them —
 * an ordinary event pipeline bumps a dependency and publishes nothing. A non-empty list makes this a
 * <b>release pipeline</b>: a green run announces one {@code SoftwareRelease} per entry, carrying the
 * version out of the event that triggered it. See {@link CiArtifact}.
 *
 * <p>{@code configPath} is the file it came from — the {@code *} is freely chosen and completely
 * ignored as a selector (it names the trigger for humans), but the path itself is <b>identity</b>:
 * it is recorded on the run and it is one third of the unique constraint that makes a triggered run
 * at-most-once. Two different trigger files in one repository matching the same event are two runs
 * by design; they are two declared pipelines.
 *
 * <p>{@code checkout} is null for every file that declares none — the run then builds the head of
 * {@code main}, as every event trigger always has. Declared, the run builds <b>the commit the
 * event names</b>: the two paths are dot-paths into the payload, resolved per event.
 *
 * <p><b>A trigger says nothing about what a red run of it is worth</b>, and there is nothing left
 * for it to say. There was a {@code gating} component here, {@code true} unless the file declared
 * {@code gating: false}, and it went with the concept (ticket 9441bc6e; {@link
 * CiConfigSchema#REFUSED_GATING_KEY} carries the argument). A red run is a red verdict.
