/**
 * Executes one pipeline step. The sole implementation is {@code CiDaemonStepRunner} in the service
 * module: it starts a container, waits for that container's own {@code qits-ci-daemon} to dial back,
 * and hands the step's script over as the reply to the daemon's {@code Initialized}. <b>Nothing on
 * this side of the seam ever runs a step's script</b> — see the invariant in {@code CLAUDE.md}.
 *
 * <p>The seam survived the swap as a name and as a <em>shape</em>: still exactly one blocking call
 * per step, so {@code CiRunService.runSteps} stays a sequential loop with one transaction per row
 * and each run worker remains sequential within one pipeline. What changed is that a step now <b>emits events</b>
 * while it runs — chunks as the container produces them, and the two lifecycle instants the host
 * stamps — instead of only answering once at the end.
 *
 * <p>Tests replace this bean with a scripted-event fake ({@code @io.quarkus.test.Mock}) so the
 * suites stay docker-free. Both fakes are scripted: no fake anywhere performs real step semantics,
 * which is what keeps {@code bash -c <repo content>} out of this repository entirely.

  /**
   * Everything one step execution needs — ids and strings only, never entities.
   *
   * <p>{@code repo} is how the step addresses the repository it builds: the storage id it has always
   * carried, plus the public {@code (projectId, name)} pair when the run's announcing push carried
   * one. The implementation turns it into the clone URL and into the step's own {@code
   * QITS_CI_PROJECT_ID}/{@code QITS_CI_REPO_NAME}; with no pair it builds the id-addressed URL this
   * service always built.
   *
   * <p>{@code daemonBinaryUrl} is resolved once per run from {@link #pinDaemon()} and repeated into
   * every one of that run's containers, so a deploy landing mid-run cannot make step 3 speak a
   * different protocol than step 1. {@code timeoutSeconds} is the step's own deadline — the
   * per-step {@code timeout-seconds} from the pipeline config, or the {@code
   * qits.ci.step-timeout-seconds} default — enforced by the daemon inside the container, with the
   * host holding a longer backstop behind it.
   *
   * <p>{@code docker} is the step's own {@code docker: true} declaration, carried across the seam
   * untouched: this side neither interprets it nor defaults it, and the implementation turns it into
   * a bind mount of the host's docker socket. It travels here rather than being read from config
   * because it is a <em>property of the step</em> — one step of a run may have it and the next may
   * not, and the run row records each of them the same way.
   *
   * <p>{@code user} is the step's own {@code user:} declaration, carried across untouched like
   * {@code docker}. Empty means the config named nobody and the image's default stands. The
   * implementation turns it into the container's {@code --user}, which is the only place it can be
   * turned into anything: a step container runs {@code --cap-drop=ALL} and can neither {@code su}
   * nor {@code chown} from the inside.
   *
   * <p>{@code env} is <b>run-scoped</b> environment the container gets on top of the fixed contract:
   * today exactly the {@code QITS_EVENT_*} four an event-triggered run carries, and empty on every
   * push. It is a map rather than four fields because what it holds is a property of the <em>trigger</em>
   * and this seam has no business enumerating triggers; it is emitted in sorted key order so an argv
   * stays something a test can assert literally. <b>It never carries anything a repository authored</b>
   * — the implementation writes the platform's own variables after these, so nothing here can shadow
   * the contract the daemon boots on.
