/**
 * The parsed {@code when:} of a {@code .config/qits/ci-event-*.yml} — the selection a repository
 * declares over the payload of the event it named. A <b>data-only matcher document</b>: it is
 * evaluated by {@link CiEventSelectionEvaluator} and never interpreted, never templated, and never
 * handed to a shell.
 *
 * <p><b>That is the decision rather than a style.</b> The evaluation input is a payload authored by
 * another service and reaching qits-ci through an unauthenticated intake; interpolating it into a
 * shell "just for a true/false" would be remote influence over {@code sh -c} on the CI host, which
 * is the class of surface this repository has carefully avoided everywhere else (see {@code
 * CiIdentifiers} and {@code StepContainerSettings.BOOTSTRAP}). Bash stays what it already is here: the
 * <em>step</em> language, running in a step container after the trigger has decided.
 *
 * <h2>The shape, and why it is this one</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code when:} is a <b>list of groups</b>, and groups are <b>OR</b>'d.
 *   <li>A group is a <b>map of dot-path → matcher</b>, and its entries are <b>AND</b>'d.
 *   <li>A map value may be a <b>list of matchers</b>, also AND'd — the one thing a plain map cannot
 *       express is two matchers on the same path in one group, and this restores it with no second
 *       nesting form.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>So "fire if any group fully matches" covers x AND y (one group, two entries) and x OR y (two
 * groups) without a structural choice at every level. An <b>absent or empty</b> {@code when:} is
 * {@link #unconditional()}: the trigger fires for every event of the name it declared. That is the
 * documented meaning and it is deliberate — a repository writing only {@code event:} has said
 * something complete, and reading it as "matches nothing" would make the commonest trigger the one
 * that silently never fires.
 *
 * <p>Paths are <b>navigation only</b>: dots between object keys, no wildcards, no filters, no
 * indexing. Every payload this platform emits is a flat-to-shallow canonical JSON object, and a
 * dot-path over one is a small loop rather than a dependency. {@code event:} matches the envelope's
 * {@code name} exactly and is not part of a selection.

   * {@code prefix} cover the release train, and a regex invites exactly the complexity a data-only
   * document exists to avoid.
   *
   * <p>Values compare as <b>strings</b>. The canonical payload is JSON, so a non-string value
   * compares by its JSON literal ({@code 3}, {@code true}, {@code ["a"]}) — which is what a repository
   * sees when it reads the event log, and therefore what it can write down without guessing at a
   * coercion table.
