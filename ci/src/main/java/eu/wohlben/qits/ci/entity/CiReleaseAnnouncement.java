/**
 * One {@code SoftwareRelease} a green release pipeline <b>owes</b>: the artifact it declared, the
 * version it published under, and — once the release fact is in — when the announcement was made.
 *
 * <p>{@link #announcedAt} null is the whole of "still owed". The row stays after the announcement as
 * the record that it happened, so this table reads as the account of every artifact this instance
 * published and of every one that published without a release behind it.
 *
 * <p>{@link #runId} is a plain string and not a relation: the obligation must outlive whatever
 * happens to the run row, which is the same reason {@code superseded_by_run_id} is not a foreign key
 * either.
 *
 * <p>{@code @Uncaused} by decision: {@link #triggerEventId} IS the cause — the event that triggered
 * the run, already on the row because it is what the published event is stamped with as its parent —
 * so a generic causation column would be that column again under a second name. The same argument
 * {@link CiScmRelease} makes, applied to a row that names its cause for a different reason. (It was
 * first made by {@code CiDaemonPin}, whose {@code event_id} was the adopting release; that entity
 * and its table went with the daemon pin ladder.)
