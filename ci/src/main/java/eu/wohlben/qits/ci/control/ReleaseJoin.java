/**
 * The join that decides whether a green release pipeline may announce a {@code SoftwareRelease}:
 * <b>both</b> a green release-pipeline run for a {@code (repository, version)} and an {@code
 * SCMRelease} for that same pair, in either order, or no announcement at all.
 *
 * <h2>Why the second fact exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>A green release-recipe run used to announce one {@code SoftwareRelease} per {@code artifacts:}
 * entry off <em>any</em> trigger. A bootstrap replay pushes a release tag without releasing anything
 * — the tag is a durable fact being restored, not novelty being announced — so every rebootstrap
 * impersonated a release: the train woke, every consumer ran a bump, and each bump ended in a release
 * call against a qits-workspaces the boot had not deployed yet. bootstrap-replay-plan.md's WP2.
 *
 * <p>The vocabulary already draws the line. A <b>restore</b> re-establishes SCM state, so it produces
 * only {@code SCMPublishTag}. A <b>release</b> additionally announces novelty, and {@code SCMRelease}
 * is that announcement — <b>only qits-workspaces publishes it</b>. So a real release produces both
 * events and a replay produces one, and this class is that difference made into a rule.
 *
 * <h2>The key, and where each side derives it</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code (repository, version)}, one key with two producers:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The run.</b> {@code repository} is {@code ci_run.repo_id}, the repository whose pipeline
 *       published. {@code version} is read out of the payload of the event that triggered the run —
 *       {@code version} on an {@code SCMRelease}, {@code tagName} on an {@code SCMPublishTag}, which
 *       IS the version string, since a release stamp is the name of the tag the release push
 *       created. {@code CiRunService.releaseVersionOf} is the one place that choice is made.
 *   <li><b>The release.</b> {@code repository} and {@code version} off the {@code SCMRelease}
 *       payload, with {@code repositoryName} recorded beside the id as a second spelling — see
 *       {@link CiScmRelease}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Arrival order, and why neither half may be in memory</h2>
 *
 * <p>On a real release the two race, and all four orders have to work:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>an {@code SCMRelease}-triggered run goes green — both facts are one row, and it announces at
 *       green exactly as it always did. That path takes no lookup at all: the event that caused the
 *       run IS the release announcement, so the join is closed by construction. It is also what keeps
 *       the manual trigger door working, since a hand-supplied {@code SCMRelease} rides no bus and
 *       leaves no fact row;
 *   <li>a tag-triggered run goes green with the release already recorded — announced at green;
 *   <li>a tag-triggered run goes green first — the announcement is <b>owed</b>, and the {@code
 *       SCMRelease} makes it when it arrives;
 *   <li>a tag-triggered run goes green and no {@code SCMRelease} ever comes — nothing is announced,
 *       ever. <b>No timeout and no fallback</b>: a replay has no novelty to announce, and a deadline
 *       that eventually announced anyway would be the defect with a delay in front of it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both halves are therefore rows rather than state: {@link CiReleaseAnnouncement} for what a run
 * owes and {@link CiScmRelease} for what was really released. A restart between the two costs
 * nothing, which is this platform's standing rule that announcements must not be lost.
 *
 * <h2>At-least-once, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>An announcement is <b>published first and marked after</b>, inside one transaction that holds
 * the owed rows locked. So two drivers of the same key cannot both announce (the loser re-reads and
 * finds nothing owed), and a crash between the publish and the commit leaves the row owed — the boot
 * sweep announces it again. Losing an announcement is the failure this class exists to prevent;
 * making one twice is a nuisance the other way round, and that is the trade taken.
 *
 * <h2>The priority rides through here, and this class is the only reason it can</h2>
 *
 * <p>A release request carries a priority — declared on its participating branches in qits-projects,
 * folded there into one effective value — and {@code SCMRelease} carries it down. qits-ci
 * <b>transcribes</b> it onto {@code SoftwareRelease} and acts on it nowhere: the run queue is FIFO
 * and stays FIFO, {@code ci_run} does not have the column, and no comparison anywhere in this service
 * reads the value. Queue ordering is the next feature; this is the inert data it will read.
 *
 * <p>It lands on {@link CiScmRelease} rather than on the owed row, and it is <b>resolved at announce
 * time</b> rather than carried in — which falls out of the arrival orders above. An owed row exists
 * from the moment a run goes green, possibly long before any release does and in a process that no
 * longer runs by the time one arrives; the fact row is the only half of the join that knows what the
 * release said. So the tag-first order reads the priority off a row written after the obligation was,
 * and the release-first order reads it off one written before — same lookup, same answer. A drive
 * with no fact row behind it (a run whose own trigger was the release, which is the manual door's
 * shape) resolves null, and null reaches the wire as an absent key.
 *
 * <h2>What this class is NOT, and the deploy that looks like it is</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here can announce before the run that published.</b> An owed row is written by a
 * green run and by nothing else, and a run owes rows only for what its own trigger file's {@code
 * artifacts:} declared — {@code CiRunService.announceRelease} returns on a null declaration before
 * this class is reached at all. So a release request's QA pipeline, which declares nothing, cannot
 * satisfy a join for a version it never built, however green and however recent it is; and an {@code
 * SCMRelease} arriving at tag time announces exactly the rows that already exist, which for a repo
 * whose release pipeline is still QUEUED is none. {@code ReleaseJoinTest} pins both directions.
 *
 * <p>That is worth stating because the symptom points here and the cause is elsewhere. A deployment
 * of {@code qits/<app>:<version>} appearing minutes after the tag — failing {@code IMAGE_MISSING}
 * because the release pipeline has not pushed yet — is qits-deployments' <b>manual door</b> ({@code
 * POST /platform-deployments/api/events/software-released}), knocked by an operator or a script
 * before the image run finished. It is distinguishable in the deployment REQUEST row: the bus door
 * records the {@code packageName} the release announced, the manual door records none. And it is not
 * free — the manual door writes a request row, {@code ReleaseTips} takes the newest request row as
 * its floor, and the genuine {@code SoftwareRelease} arriving later is then refused as "not the
 * newest release of this application any more". So the early knock does not merely fail; it can cost
 * the deployment that would have worked.
