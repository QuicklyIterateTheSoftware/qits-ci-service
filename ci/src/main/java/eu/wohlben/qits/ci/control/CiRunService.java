/**
 * The pipeline orchestrator: a domain event matched a repository's trigger file → run the pipeline
 * that file declared, sequentially → record per-step pass/fail. Runs execute on a bounded pool of
 * daemon workers (the intake returns immediately; {@code qits.ci.concurrent-builds} controls how
 * many runs may execute at once), with each DB transition in its own {@link
 * QuarkusTransaction#requiringNew()} bracket so the slow container work never holds a transaction
 * (worker threads have no request context; the {@code BlobService}/{@code GitHostRoutes} stance).
 *
 * <p>That worker now parks on a socket rather than on a process — {@link CiStepRunner} waits for a
 * step container's own daemon — but the shape is unchanged: one blocking call per step, in order.
 *
 * <p><b>There is ONE way in, and that is the whole of the 2026-09-05 change.</b> {@link
 * #onEventTrigger} takes a domain event that matched a {@code .config/qits/ci-event-*.yml}: it names
 * no commit of its own and arrives with its pipeline already parsed at the head of {@code main}
 * ({@code CiEventTriggerService} had to read the file to know there was anything to run).
 *
 * <p>There used to be a second, {@code onPostReceive} — one accepted run per pushed branch ref,
 * reading {@code .config/qits/ci-post-receive.yml} out of the pushed commit on this class's own
 * worker. <b>The platform runs no CI outside release requests</b>, so every repository's
 * {@code ci-post-receive.yml} was deleted; the engine arm outlived them and kept enqueueing a run per
 * push against a file none of them carried — thirteen phantom {@code QUEUED} rows on 2026-09-05,
 * each holding a runner slot to discover that nothing was declared. An ordinary push now triggers
 * nothing at all, and it does so because there is no code left that could: no listener, no accept, no
 * worker half, no parser. {@code SCMPublishCommit} still reaches the generic trigger engine like
 * every other event, so a repository that <em>declares</em> {@code event: SCMPublishCommit} is served
 * by the ordinary grammar — which is a capability rather than a special case, and is why the engine
 * arm stays.
 *
 * <p><b>Steps are persisted at their end.</b> A {@link CiStep} row is inserted once, already
 * terminal; while a step runs it has no row at all and the live output is the runner's in-memory
 * relay, exposed on the run read surface as {@code live}. The never-run remainder is written {@code
 * SKIPPED} when the run closes. So the database never holds a half-written step and there is no
 * insert-then-update anywhere in a run.
 *
 * <h2>Patience: the READ surface holds through a short outage, and so do two request-path writes</h2>
 *
 * <p>The pool opens its connections through {@code PatientPgDriver}, so a request that has executed
 * nothing waits for postgres to come back rather than failing. What that cannot help is a connection
 * severed <b>mid-flight</b>, after the statements ran. The seven caller-facing reads at the bottom of
 * this class ({@link #activeRuns}, {@link #finishedRuns}, {@link #repositorySummaries}, {@link
 * #runsFor}, {@link #requireRun}, {@link #stepsFor}, {@link #repositoryIds}) are wrapped in {@link
 * DbRetry#call}, which sits <b>outside</b> {@code requiringNew}, never inside: inside one it would
 * re-run statements in a transaction the severed connection already doomed.
 *
 * <p><b>A write needs the other method, and it is not the same trade.</b> {@link DbRetry#inNewTx}
 * owns the transaction boundary, so it can retry the attempts that certainly did not commit — a
 * connection-class failure thrown out of the <em>body</em> — and rethrows everything the transaction
 * manager reports, because a lost commit acknowledgement is undecidable. Each wrapped body ends with
 * {@code runs.flush()} on purpose: an ORM flushes at commit by default, which would put the write on
 * the undecidable side of that line.
 *
 * <p><b>Two writes are wrapped, and they are the two on a request-shaped thread</b> — {@link
 * #acceptEventRun} and both transactions of {@link #cancel}. Their bodies are database-only: no
 * container is launched, no event published, no HTTP call made inside one, because the retry re-runs
 * the whole body. {@code acceptEventRun}'s check-then-insert-then-supersede is wrapped <b>whole</b>,
 * which is the only legal shape for it — splitting the bracket would cost the dedupe its race — and
 * that is sound because every statement in it is derived from the current database state and from the
 * arriving request, so a rolled-back attempt leaves the next one deciding the same way.
 *
 * <p><b>What is deliberately NOT wrapped.</b> No worker-thread transition ({@link #startQueued},
 * {@link #finishRun}, {@code failIncompleteSteps}, {@link #discardRun}, the step inserts) is wrapped:
 * those have their own recovery in {@code sweepInterrupted} at boot, which is a stronger answer than
 * a fifteen-second wait on the run worker. The rule they follow was written for a third case that no
 * longer exists — {@code acceptPostReceive} ran inside the push listener's claiming transaction,
 * where a retry outliving that claim's connection would have committed a {@code QUEUED} row behind an
 * event the funnel then re-offered — and it is worth keeping in front of you the next time an accept
 * is called from inside somebody else's transaction.
 *
 * <p>The validation each listing does — a non-positive {@code limit} — happens <em>before</em> the
 * wrap, so a caller bug is still one immediate 400 rather than something retried for fifteen
 * seconds. {@link NotFoundException} is thrown inside the wrap and is not retried either, because
 * {@code DbRetry} waits on connection failures only; every other throwable propagates at once.
 *
 * <h2>The run row is born at accept, not at start</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #onEventTrigger} inserts a {@link CiRunStatus#QUEUED} row before it returns</b>, and
 * the worker flips it to {@code RUNNING} when it dequeues it. Before that, a queued run was a closure
 * on this class's executor and nothing else — invisible to every read surface, and gone with the
 * process. That was the lossy intake: a redeploy landing between acceptance and the build lost the
 * build with no row anywhere to say so.
 *
 * <p>So the recording rule is <b>revised, deliberately</b>. It used to read "a run is only ever
 * recorded when it says something true about a commit", which was a statement about when the INSERT
 * happens. It now reads: <b>a run row exists from the moment the work is accepted, and it is removed
 * again if it turns out to describe nothing that happened.</b> What a <em>finished</em> worker
 * leaves behind is unchanged, outcome for outcome — the difference is a transient {@code QUEUED} row
 * in between, visible to {@code GET /ci/api/runs/active} and, briefly, to a repository's listing.
 *
 * <p>Recording semantics, per outcome, with what became of the accept-time row:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the repository no longer holds the commit ⇒ <b>discarded</b>, discovered in a step
 *       container's own checkout and confirmed with {@link CiConfigSource#commitHeld} — the commit
 *       the run was accepted for no longer exists, so a red run would blame a commit whose build was
 *       never broken;
 *   <li>a pipeline with no steps ⇒ a trivially green run;
 *   <li>cancelled while still {@code QUEUED} ⇒ {@code CANCELLED}, with no steps — cancellation is a
 *       user decision rather than a failed pipeline verdict.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Two outcomes left this list with the push path and are worth knowing were once here, because
 * both are still reachable states on a historical row: {@code CONFIG_ERROR} (the config was read on
 * this worker, so a broken one was a run) and the discard for a repository that declared no pipeline
 * at all. A trigger file is read and parsed by {@code CiEventTriggerService} <em>before</em> a row
 * exists now, so a broken or absent one is a WARN and no run rather than a row to settle.
 *
 * <h2>What a restart costs now</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #sweepInterrupted} restarts a {@code RUNNING} event pipeline: the complete input
 * snapshot is on the row, so its partial step records are cleared and the run is restarted. Event
 * pipelines must therefore be idempotent. Anything else left {@code RUNNING} is failed instead —
 * which after the push retirement means a leftover {@code POST_RECEIVE} row from a predecessor
 * deployment, since replaying repository-authored work that already began is not safe and this engine
 * could not replay it anyway. Every {@code QUEUED} row a successor can run is re-enqueued oldest
 * first; one it cannot is settled {@code CANCELLED} rather than left to sit in {@code
 * /ci/api/runs/active} forever.
 *
 * <p>An event-triggered row also stores its event envelope and exact trigger-file content. The
 * worker reparses that immutable snapshot, so a queued event run is recoverable without consulting
 * a branch that may have moved and without relying on an at-most-once event redelivery.
