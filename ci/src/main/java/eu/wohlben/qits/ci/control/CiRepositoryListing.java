/**
 * "Every repository the platform holds, with its public name" — qits-projects' catalogue, read once

 *
 * <p>It replaces {@link GitHostRepoListing} as the enumeration the trigger engine prefers, and the
 * reason is the identity cutover rather than taste: the git host's own {@code GET /git} is an
 * internal storage listing that answers opaque UUIDs, and a UUID is not something a trigger file can
 * name or a clone URL can be built from. qits-projects is where the {@code (projectId, name)} pair
 * lives, so that is where the candidate list comes from.

 *   GET {qits.ci.projects-url}/projects/api/repositories
 *   200 {"repositories":[{"id","projectId","name","mainBranch"}, …]}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>An interface rather than a call so {@code ci} stays free of {@code java.net.http} and of
 * another service's wire shape — the same reason {@link CiConfigSource} and {@link
 * GitHostRepoListing} are ports here and hand-rolled clients in {@code service}.
 *
 * <p><b>Two answers, and they mean different things.</b> {@link #configured()} says whether this
 * deployment names a qits-projects at all; {@link #repositories()} says what it holds. An
 * unconfigured listing is not a failed read — it is a deployment that predates the cutover, or a
 * clone-alone build, and the caller falls back to the git host's listing rather than shrinking the
 * candidate set. That is the campaign's standing kill-switch shape.
