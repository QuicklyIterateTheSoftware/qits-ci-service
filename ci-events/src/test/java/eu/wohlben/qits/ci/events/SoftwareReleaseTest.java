/**
 * qits-ci's second event, on the wire — the same plain-JUnit contract test {@link
 * BuildSuccessfulTest} is, for the same reason: an event class is data, and the serializer it is
 * asserted against builds its own mapper precisely so no container is needed to know what it emits.
 *
 * <p><b>The payload below is what every downstream release pipeline reads.</b> Seven fields now, byte
 * for byte, in the alphabetical order the canonical form fixes — a change here that is not also a
 * change in the repositories triggering on it is a cross-repo break rather than a refactor.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code projectId}, {@code repoId} and {@code repoName} were ADDED to the original four and
 * nothing was repointed</b>, which is what the byte assertions below are for: {@code repository}
 * still carries what it always carried, so a consumer selecting on it is unaffected, and the new keys
 * sit beside it for a consumer that has to address the repository rather than recognise it.
 * {@code repoName} is the one the deployer cannot work without — a released repository's
 * deployments.yml is read at {@code /git/<projectId>/<repoName>/blob/…}, and the id-addressed
 * fallback is refused to everyone but qits-projects. The null cases have their own tests, because
 * "absent" is the shipped answer for a repository the candidate listing knows only by id and a
 * consumer must read it as "ask somebody" rather than as an address.
