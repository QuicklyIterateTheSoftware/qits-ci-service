/**
 * A CI run failed: this repository, at this commit, on this branch, finished red at this time —
 * and {@code outcome} says which kind of red.
 *
 * <p>Announced by qits-ci when a run reaches a terminal failure — {@code FAILED}, {@code
 * TIMED_OUT} or {@code CONFIG_ERROR}, and {@code outcome} carries that word verbatim. What it is
 * <b>not</b> announced for is as much of the contract: a {@code CANCELLED} run says nothing (a
 * person withdrew the question), and a run superseded by a newer push says nothing (its row is
 * bookkeeping about the queue, not a fact about the commit). So a subscriber keeping per-commit
 * build status — the reason this event exists — reads every {@code BuildFailed} as a build that
 * genuinely ran, or genuinely could not run, against exactly that commit.
 *
 * <p>The field conventions are {@link BuildSuccessful}'s, stated there at length and only named
 * here: {@code occurredAt} is {@code finishedAt}; {@code eventId} is generated when absent, final
 * once set, and travels in the envelope rather than the payload; {@code repoId} is the storage id
 * and always set, while {@code projectId} and {@code repoName} ride together when the announcing
 * push arrived name-addressed and are omitted from the canonical payload when it did not; {@code
 * gating} is <b>null for a gating run</b> and an explicit {@code false} only for a non-gating one,
 * so absent reads as gating. There is no {@code imageDigest}: a failed run published nothing worth
 * naming.
