/**
 * The sole production {@link CiConfigSource}: it reads a repository's pipeline config straight off
 * the git host's content endpoints.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   GET {qits.ci.git-host-url}/git/&lt;projectId&gt;/&lt;repoName&gt;/blob/&lt;rev&gt;/&lt;path&gt;  → the raw bytes
 *   GET {qits.ci.git-host-url}/git/&lt;projectId&gt;/&lt;repoName&gt;/tree/&lt;rev&gt;[/&lt;path&gt;] → {"entries":[…]}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>…or the id-addressed {@code /git/&lt;repoId&gt;/…} of the same two routes for a repository whose
 * public name qits-ci does not know — see {@link #repoUrl}, which is the one place that choice is
 * made.
 *
 * <p>Both answer the commit they resolved in a {@code Git-Commit-Sha} header, and {@code rev} is a
 * full sha or a ref name — which is what lets a trigger listing resolve the head once and then read
 * every file <b>at that sha</b>, and what lets {@link #commitHeld} ask about a commit rather than
 * about a branch. That is the whole of why this class no longer keeps a bare mirror per repository:
 * the wire protocol has no blob-at-path verb, so reading one file used to mean cloning the
 * repository first, with a local ref two workers could race for. The mirror, the {@code git}
 * shell-outs and the contended-fetch retry are gone with the reason for them.
 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code service} rather than beside the port in {@code ci} for the reason every
 * client here does: {@code ci} stays free of {@code java.net.http} and of another service's wire
 * shape. Same arrangement as {@code HttpGitHostRepoListing}, one segment over.
 *
 * <h2>What a status means</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>200</b> — the bytes. Past {@link #MAX_CONFIG_BYTES} a trigger file cannot be a config and
 *       is skipped with a warning rather than parsed as a head.
 *   <li><b>404 on a tree</b> — the rev itself does not resolve. On {@link #commitHeld} that is the
 *       whole answer; on the trigger listing it costs one more read (the root tree at the branch) to
 *       tell "this repository declares nothing" from "this repository could not be asked".
 *   <li><b>anything else</b> — the host could not answer, so nothing is recorded. A read failure
 *       must not invent a gate.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note what {@code GONE} means, because it narrowed once and never widened back: the repository
 * does not hold the commit at all. It used to mean "no longer an ancestor of the branch tip", which
 * discarded a run for a commit that had merely been force-pushed past.
 *
 * <h2>The timeouts</h2>
 *
 * <p>Short and bounded, because the callers are single-threaded workers: {@code ci-trigger-worker}
 * for an arriving event, where every candidate repository costs one of these calls, and {@code
 * ci-run-worker} for the commit-held probe. {@link #CONNECT_TIMEOUT} 2s and {@link #REQUEST_TIMEOUT}
 * 5s, so a git host that has stopped answering costs seconds per repository rather than a step's
 * whole timeout. Same 2s connect bound {@code HttpGitHostRepoListing} and {@code
 * EventsDaemonReleaseLog} carry.
 *
 * <p>Every identifier is validated by {@link CiIdentifiers} before it reaches a URL, because the
 * intake that supplies them is reachable without a session. A branch may legitimately contain
 * {@code /}, and a rev is one path segment, so it is percent-encoded on the way in.
 *
 * <p>An <b>instance</b> {@code HttpClient}, never a static one — a static client is built at
 * image-build time and native-image refuses the heap it lands in.
