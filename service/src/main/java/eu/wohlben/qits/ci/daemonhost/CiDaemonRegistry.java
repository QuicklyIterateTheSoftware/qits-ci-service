/**
 * The in-memory launch table: every step container qits-ci has started but not yet reaped, keyed by
 * the {@code daemonId} it was launched with, holding that launch's secret, the (run, step) it
 * belongs to, its connection once it dials, its lifecycle phase, and the listener its output goes
 * to. It is the in-JVM half of the control plane — {@link CiDaemonSocket} owns the WebSocket
 * lifecycle and forwards frames here, exactly as {@code WorkspaceDaemonRegistry} sits behind {@code
 * DaemonControlSocket} in qits-workspaces.
 *
 * <p><b>The blocking bridge.</b> Each run executes on one worker ({@code CiRunService}), one step at
 * a time, and that thread used to park on a {@code docker run} process. It now parks
 * here instead: {@link #awaitRegistered}, {@link #awaitHello}, {@link #awaitAckConfirmed}, {@link
 * #awaitInitialized} and {@link #awaitFinished} each block on one {@code CompletableFuture} per
 * lifecycle transition while chunks
 * flow to the step's listener as they arrive. The failure mode that swap introduces is anything that
 * never returns
 * wedging all of CI, so <b>nothing in this package waits without a deadline</b> — and that covers
 * three kinds of wait, not one:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the lifecycle futures, through {@link #await}, the single place a future is waited on and
 *       one that always passes a deadline;
 *   <li>writing a frame, through {@link #send}, which spells out {@code .await().atMost(…)} rather
 *       than taking the {@code sendTextAndAwait} convenience;
 *   <li>closing a socket, through {@link #closeBounded}, for the same reason and against the same
 *       convenience — {@code closeAndAwait} is {@code close().await().indefinitely()} with the
 *       untimed part one frame out of sight.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code CiDaemonRegistryTimeoutTest} holds the behaviour and greps this package for every one of
 * those conveniences, so a fourth wait added untimed fails a build rather than a run.
 *
 * <p><b>The secret authenticates the container, and only for one thing.</b> It is minted per launch
 * from {@link SecureRandom}, injected as env, presented on the dial, compared with {@link
 * MessageDigest#isEqual} and zeroed when the launch is reaped. There is no storage beyond this map,
 * which is what makes the restart story free: a qits-ci restart forgets every secret by
 * construction, so a daemon from a previous life dialling in presents one this registry does not
 * know and is closed 1008. What the secret authorizes is exactly "deliver data about this run" — the
 * container turns hostile the moment step code runs in it, so everything arriving over that
 * connection is attacker-influenced data, recorded and never trusted (which is why timestamps are
 * host-stamped and a {@code Hello}'s {@code daemonId} is checked rather than believed).
 *
 * <p>{@link CiDaemonStepRunner} is what drives this in production, one step at a time.
