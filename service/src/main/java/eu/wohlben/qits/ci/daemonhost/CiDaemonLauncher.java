/**
 * Asks qits-containers to put one step container at a place, and to take it away again: the sandbox
 * flags, the entrypoint overridden to a fixed host-authored bootstrap, and the run's whole context
 * as environment.
 *
 * <p><b>This process holds no docker socket and spawns no process at all.</b> Every line of docker
 * vocabulary that used to live here — {@code run}, {@code logs}, {@code rm}, {@code ps}, {@code
 * network inspect}/{@code create} — is now one HTTP call to the orchestrator, which owns the daemon.
 * What survived is the seam: the same five public methods, the same {@link LaunchSpec}, and the
 * same {@link Launched}, so {@link CiDaemonStepRunner} reads exactly as it did.
 *
 * <p><b>qits-ci still executes nothing.</b> The step's script never appears in a spec assembled
 * here: it reaches the container as the reply on the socket that container's own daemon dialled, and
 * executes as that daemon's child inside the sandbox. {@link #BOOTSTRAP} is a compile-time constant
 * with <b>zero interpolation</b>, and it now travels as JSON rather than as an argv — {@code
 * entrypoint} is {@code ["/bin/sh"]} and {@code args} is {@code ["-c", BOOTSTRAP]}, two list
 * elements the orchestrator hands {@code ProcessBuilder} one at a time. Zero interpolation is
 * therefore preserved <em>by construction</em>: there is no string this text is concatenated into on
 * either side of the wire.
 *
 * <p><b>Containers are removed explicitly and never self-remove.</b> A self-removing container races
 * the log capture that is the only diagnosis a container which never registered can offer, so every
 * teardown path is a delete — and the one that needs the log asks for it in the <em>same</em> call
 * ({@link #destroyWithLogs}), which is what makes the ordering impossible to lose. The registry's
 * own {@code maxAge} garbage collection is the backstop under all of it: a delete this process could
 * not make still ends in a container the orchestrator removes.
 *
 * <p>This is the whole of qits-ci's container vocabulary. {@link CiDaemonStepRunner} is its only
 * caller in production; {@code CiDaemonGateIT} drives it against a real orchestrator.

   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>401 and 403</b> — the token this process presents was minted by an idp that has just
   *       been replaced, or the orchestrator's JWKS is a cutover behind. Each attempt asks the
   *       {@code TokenSource} again, so a fresh post-cutover token is picked up by retrying and by
   *       nothing else.
   *   <li><b>Nothing answered</b> — the orchestrator is restarting. Retrying is safe here for a
   *       reason a bare {@code docker run} never had: {@code ensure} is a PUT per {@code
   *       (owner, workload, ref)} and the ref is this step's own container name, so a second attempt
   *       addresses the same place. A container the first attempt created and could not tell us
   *       about is adopted rather than duplicated.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>The window sits BESIDE the launch deadline, not inside it.</b> {@link #launchTimeout()}
   * is one attempt's deadline and stays exactly that — it is mostly an image pull, and shortening
   * it to fit a retry budget would turn a cold pull into a failed launch. {@code
   * qits.ci.containers.launch-patience} bounds when a <em>fresh</em> attempt may start, so the worst
   * case is the patience plus one whole launch deadline (PT90S + 60s as shipped). That is
   * deliberately far inside {@link #MAX_AGE_SLOP}'s fifteen minutes: an unreachable first attempt
   * may have created the container, its {@code maxAge} clock starts there, and the slop is what
   * keeps the registry's GC a backstop rather than a second timeout even then. Nothing downstream
   * shifts — {@code CiDaemonStepRunner} starts its register deadline when this method returns.
   *
   * <p><b>A 2xx whose container is not there is a failed launch.</b> The wire contract is explicit
   * that an {@code ensure} whose container did not start is a true answer rather than a failed
   * request — the row exists, it says {@code MISSING}, and it carries what docker said — so the

   * docker: true} sets {@code hostDockerSocket}, and the orchestrator bind-mounts the host's socket
   * at the path the step image's CLI looks at by default — which is how publishing works: the step's
   * CLI streams its build context to the <em>host's</em> daemon, which builds, tags and pushes.
   * Where that path is is the orchestrator's deployment fact now, not this service's, which is why
   * {@code qits.ci.docker-socket-path} is gone. The sandbox stays exactly as it is for such a step —
   * {@code capDropAll} and {@code noNewPrivileges} cost a socket <em>client</em> nothing, and keeping
   * them unconditional keeps them meaning what they mean for every step that does not opt in. They
   * also do not make the opt-in safe: a step holding this socket is <b>root-equivalent on the
   * host</b>, because those flags fence the step's own process tree and not what the daemon will do
   * on its behalf. That is accepted for the POC and it is per step, declared in the repository's
   * config where a diff shows it — see {@code AGENTS.md}'s untrusted-input section.
   *
   * <p><b>The container name is this service's own and travels as {@code explicitName}.</b> The
   * orchestrator would derive one; qits-ci names its containers so that a person reading {@code
   * docker ps} during a build sees the run, and so that the name and the {@code ref} are the same
   * string — see {@link #launch}.
   *
   * <p><b>The registry coordinates are injected into every container, opted in or not.</b> They are
   * two strings a publish script would otherwise have to hard-code, and a script that hard-codes a
   * deployment's registry address is a script that breaks on the next deployment. Note what dials
   * that address: not this process, and not the step's CLI either, but the <b>host's docker
   * daemon</b>, on the far side of the mounted socket. So resolvability and TLS trust are the
   * daemon's — a deployment must make the host reach it, and list it in {@code insecure-registries}
   * while the registry speaks plain HTTP.
   *
   * <p><b>The package registry roots go into every container too, and their caveat is the exact
   * inverse.</b> {@code QITS_MAVEN_REGISTRY_URL} and {@code QITS_DOCS_URL} follow the same rule as
   * the npm pair below.
   * {@code QITS_NPM_REGISTRY_URL} and {@code QITS_NPM_PROXY_URL} are dialled by the <b>step
   * container itself</b> — an npm CLI speaking plain HTTP to a service alias on the shared network,
   * needing no socket, no privilege and no {@code docker: true}. So the value that is right here is
   * the in-network one, and a host-published mapping substituted for {@code QITS_REGISTRY} (the
   * local stack's {@code registry.dev.localhost:8080}) must <b>not</b> be substituted for these: a
   * step container has no such address. Two variables, two opposite readings of "reachable from
   * where" — which is why both are commented where they are shipped.
   *
   * <p><b>{@code QITS_WORKSPACES_URL} joins them on the same reading.</b> It is the door a step
   * knocks on to release its own repository after green tests — the release train's maintenance leg
   * — and it is an ordinary HTTP call from the container over qits-net.
   *
   * <p><b>The docker block is the one part that is NOT unconditional, and the scope is the point.</b>
   * A registry behind the edge answers an unauthenticated push with a docker Bearer challenge, so
   * the step's CLI needs a stored login to exchange for a token; reads stay anonymous and need
   * nothing. Only a step that declared {@code docker: true} can push at all, so only that step is
   * handed anything here: the two BuildKit variables, and — once the run has commissioned one — this
   * run's own credential as {@code DOCKER_CONFIG} plus the document behind it and the pair itself.
   * Every other step gets the environment it always got. The document reaches the container as an
   * environment value and becomes a file in {@link #REGISTRY_AUTH_DIR} there, which is what keeps it
   * out of the checkout and out of any build context.
