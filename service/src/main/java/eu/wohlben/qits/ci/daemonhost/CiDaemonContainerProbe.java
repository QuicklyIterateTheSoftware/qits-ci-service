/**
 * The sole production {@link DaemonProbe} (ci-daemon-autoadopt-plan.md §2.3, workstream BW): a real
 * step container with no step. It reuses the exact machinery {@code CiDaemonStepRunner} drives a
 * real step through -- {@link CiDaemonRegistry#registerLaunch}, {@link CiDaemonLauncher#launch},
 * {@link CiDaemonRegistry#awaitRegistered}, {@link CiDaemonLauncher#destroyWithLogs} on failure,
 * {@link CiDaemonRegistry#awaitHello}, {@link CiDaemonRegistry#awaitAckConfirmed} and {@link
 * CiDaemonLauncher#reap} -- so probing a candidate exercises the same production download path a
 * real run would.
 *
 * <p><b>A verdict is a round trip, not a wave.</b> {@code Hello} proves the daemon can reach the
 * host; it says nothing about whether the host can reach the daemon, and a real run depends on
 * exactly that direction for everything from {@code Ack} onward, {@code RunStep} above all. So
 * {@link #awaitVerdict} does not settle {@link DaemonProbe.Verdict#PROVEN} at {@code Hello} the way
 * an earlier version of this class did: it also waits for {@link
 * eu.wohlben.qits.cidaemon.protocol.AckReceived}, the daemon's confirmation that the host's own
 * {@code Ack} arrived. A daemon that dials, says {@code Hello} and then never confirms is {@link
 * DaemonProbe.Verdict#REJECTED} at the same deadline as every other unproven case -- it looked
 * alive and was never actually listening.
 *
 * <p><b>What it deliberately does not do.</b> It never waits for {@code Initialized}: the daemon
 * clones only after it dials, and a probe has no repository to hand it, so {@link #PROBE_REPO_ID}
 * is syntactically valid (it passes {@code CiIdentifiers.requireRepoId}) but names nothing a clone
 * can resolve. The container is reaped the moment the verdict is in -- now strictly after {@code
 * AckReceived} or the deadline, never at {@code Hello} -- which is what kills that clone along with
 * it. It is not a host-side execution of the binary either -- the daemon still runs inside the
 * sandbox {@link CiDaemonLauncher#buildWorkloadSpec} asks for, exactly as a step's daemon does.
 *
 * <p><b>Skipped under {@code LaunchMode.TEST}</b>, the same posture {@link
 * CiDaemonLauncher#onStart} takes toward its own boot reap: an ordinary {@code @QuarkusTest} that
 * somehow reaches an {@code UNPROVEN} candidate (this module carries no {@code DaemonProbe} test
 * double of its own -- {@code ci}'s {@code FakeDaemonProbe} does not cross the module's test
 * classpath) must never ask a real orchestrator for a real container. {@link
 * #probeUnconditionally} is the same logic
 * with that guard removed, package-private so a hand-wired instance can drive it against a real
 * orchestrator precisely as {@code CiDaemonHandshakeIT} hand-wires a {@link CiDaemonLauncher} for
 * the same
 * reason -- {@code LaunchMode.current()} is a JVM-wide read that a fresh instance cannot escape, so
 * bypassing the guard is the only way an {@code extended}-tagged {@code @QuarkusTest} IT can prove
 * the real container path at all. {@link #awaitVerdict} is the verdict logic on its own, with no
 * launch step at all -- what {@code CiDaemonContainerProbeTest} drives against {@link
 * FakeCiDaemon} to prove {@code REJECTED} both ways with no docker in reach.
