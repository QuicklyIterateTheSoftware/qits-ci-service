/**
 * The sole production {@link CiRepositoryListing}: {@code GET {qits.ci.projects-url}
 * /projects/api/repositories} → {@code {"repositories":[{"id","projectId","name","mainBranch"}, …]}}.
 *
 * <p>It is the enumeration the trigger engine prefers, and it exists because the git host's own
 * {@code GET /git} stopped being usable for it: after the identity cutover that route is an internal
 * storage listing answering opaque UUIDs, gated to qits-projects' own client. qits-projects is where
 * the public {@code (projectId, name)} coordinate lives, so that is where the candidate list comes
 * from — and a candidate without a name is a candidate no trigger file could ever select and no
 * clone URL could be built for.
 *
 * <p><b>The url is configured, unlike the git host's, and the key is a kill switch.</b> {@code
 * qits.ci.projects-url} has no default: unset means this listing is not {@link #configured()}, and
 * {@code ListedAndKnownCiRepos} asks the git host instead — which is what keeps a pre-cutover
 * platform triggering and a clone-alone build of this repository running with no qits-projects
 * anywhere. It could not be derived the way the git host's listing url is: this is a different
 * service at a different address, not a second path under one qits-ci already holds.
 *
 * <p><b>Never throws.</b> An unreachable service, a non-200 (the contract says a failed read is a
 * 5xx), a body that is not JSON and a body without a {@code repositories} array are each one WARN
 * naming the url and an empty list, because {@link CiRepositoryListing#repositories()}'s contract is
 * that a read failure leaves the candidate set as the known one rather than emptying it.
 *
 * <h2>What it skips, and why that is not shrinking the set</h2>
 *
 * <p>An entry with a null or blank {@code name} is dropped. It has no public address, so there is no
 * content route this engine could read its trigger files from — answering it id-addressed would be a
 * read against a route that is qits-projects' alone. An entry whose id, project or name is not
 * something {@link CiIdentifiers} accepts is dropped for the reason the git host's listing drops
 * one: all three reach a URL, and the rest of a listing is still worth evaluating.
 *
 * <h2>Authentication</h2>
 *
 * <p>It presents {@code X-Qits-User}/{@code X-Qits-Roles: qits:system} — the same forward-auth
 * identity {@code githost/HttpGitHostRepoListing} presents for the same kind of in-network read, and
 * exactly the role the endpoint's contract asks for. No bearer: qits-ci's OIDC clients were
 * audience-bound to other services, and presenting either here would be a token
 * addressed to another service — worse than none, since a request carrying no {@code Authorization}
 * falls through to the header mechanism while one carrying a wrong-audience bearer is refused. An
 * audience-bound client for this hop is a deployment-config change, and it belongs in the campaign's
 * wiring work rather than here.
 *
 * <h2>The timeouts and the cache</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both are the git-host listing's, for its reasons: this call sits on the single-threaded {@code
 * ci-trigger-worker} in front of every evaluation, so an untimed one would stall every arriving
 * event ({@link #CONNECT_TIMEOUT} 2s, {@link #REQUEST_TIMEOUT} 3s), and {@link #CACHE_TTL} five
 * seconds is so a burst of frames is one listing read rather than one per frame. Only a
 * <b>successful</b> read is cached, so a service that came back up is not invisible for a window.
 *
 * <p><b>An instance {@code HttpClient}, never a static one</b> — a static client is created at
 * image-build time and native-image refuses the heap it lands in. Reading the body is {@code
 * readTree} and a walk, so nothing here needs reflection registering either.
