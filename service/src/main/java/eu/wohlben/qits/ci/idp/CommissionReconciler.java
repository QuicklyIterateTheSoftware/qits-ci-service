/**
 * Deletes the commissioned credentials no run owns any more — the durable half of {@link
 * RunCommissions}, which can only give back what this process is still holding.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is for.</b> A commission is released when the run closes, and a process that is
 * killed mid-run closes nothing: the credential stays live at qits-idp with no run behind it. So
 * does one whose {@code DELETE} failed, and one belonging to a run this instance never entered. The
 * list of what exists is qits-idp's, the list of what is owed is the run table, and the difference
 * between them is what this reaps.
 *
 * <p><b>The predicate is deliberately narrow.</b> Only rows of this owner's — the listing shows no
 * other client's — whose {@code contextKind} is {@code ci-run}, and whose {@code contextId} is not a
 * run that is {@code QUEUED} or {@code RUNNING} right now. A commission this process holds in memory
 * is spared as well, which covers the window between a run's row going terminal and its {@code
 * runClosed}.
 *
 * <p><b>A listing that could not be read reaps nothing.</b> {@link IdpCommissioner#live()} answers
 * an empty {@code Optional} rather than an empty list for that case, and reading the two as one
 * would delete every live run's credential the first time qits-idp was slow — the same "a read
 * failure must not shrink a set" rule the candidate listing and the run queue already state.
 *
 * <p><b>Boot, on its own thread.</b> The observer runs after both existing boot observers ({@code
 * CiDaemonLauncher.BOOT_REAP_PRIORITY}, then {@code CiRunService.BOOT_SWEEP_PRIORITY}) so the run
 * table it reads is the one the sweep left, and it hands the work to a thread of its own rather than
 * blocking the startup thread on the network. That lesson was paid live by the daemon pin ladder's
 * own startup discovery — a startup observer that waits on a service loses the container
 * healthcheck's race and cd kills the deployment — and it outlived the discovery, which is deleted.
