/**
 * The read side of {@code /ci/api} (docs/epics/qits-ci/): the recorded green/red per branch,
 * visible without any session (reads are open — the gate is advisory in the MVP), plus the one write
 * a person performs, cancelling a run.
 *
 * <p>The run is the entity and the repository is a <b>filter</b>, so the listing takes {@code
 * ?repositoryId=} rather than sitting under {@code /repositories/{repoId}/}. ci does not own
 * repositories — {@code ci_run.repo_id} is a plain string in ci's own database with no relation to
 * anything — so addressing runs beneath another context's aggregate claimed a containment that does
 * not exist, and put three services under one gateway prefix. {@code {runId}} stays in the path:
 * there it is identity, not scope.
 *
 * <p><b>The reads take the pair {@code qits:admin, qits:system}; the two run-scoped writes take
 * {@code qits:admin} alone.</b> qits:system is the machine role and qits:admin the human one, and a
 * machine that has to poll a run it asked for — qits-platform-maintenance waits out every bump this
 * way — must not be granted a person's role to do it. What mutates is not widened: {@link #cancelRun}
 * and {@link #retryRun} carry their own method-level list, which replaces the class's rather than
 * adding to it.
 *
 * <p><b>There is one write here a machine really does perform, and it is the exception that proves
 * that rule.</b> {@link #cancelReleaseRequestRuns} is qits-projects withdrawing a release request's
 * CI, addressed by {@code (repoId, releaseRequestId)} because the runs it stops carry a sha nobody
 * pushed. It keeps the class's role pair — a peer service and an operator both legitimately call it —
 * and adds this resource's only {@code MachineAuth} check, on the machine arm. The rule that
 * matters is the one {@code MachineGuardTest} enforces: a new write that omits the guard ships
 * unguarded and nothing says so, so every write on this surface has a case in that file.
 *
 * <p><b>That check demanded {@code project=*} until 2026-09-05, and no real caller could satisfy
 * it.</b> The only sender of this route is qits-projects' {@code HttpQaRunCancellations}, fired
 * when a release request is superseded, and the bearer it presents is the {@code
 * <env>-qits-projects} client's — which qits-idp mints with {@code groups} of {@code qits:system},
 * {@code qits-platform:system} and {@code clients/<id>}, and <b>no structured claims at all</b>.
 * So every supersession was answered 403, swallowed at debug on the sender's side (that hop is
 * best-effort by design — the gate is correlated by merged sha and stayed correct), and superseded
 * QA runs simply kept running. The door now asks {@link #cancellationScope()}, which is {@code
 * CiEventController.scopeOf}'s ruling applied to a request that names its target. Read that method
 * before changing either.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here is hidden from the OpenAPI document any more.</b> The two reads used to carry
 * {@code @Operation(hidden = true)} on the criterion "does a client consume it, does a person invoke
 * it" — machine surfaces stay out, the cancel button goes in. The criterion was right and its answer
 * changed: qits-spa-ci reads both of these on every page it draws, so they are the JSON API a
 * first-party client consumes. Leaving them hidden would mean {@code docs/openapi.yml} — a file this
 * repo commits precisely so that a surface change shows up as a diff — omitted the entire contract
 * that client depends on, and a breaking change to {@link CiRunDto} would have landed with an empty
 * diff. The intake in {@code CiEventController} stays hidden: it really is machine-only,
 * token-guarded, and has a cross-repo wire contract with qits-artifacts.

   *       without one.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p><b>The last arm is the fix, and it is the arm the live 403 landed on.</b> Measured
   * 2026-09-05: qits-projects' bearer for this hop is the {@code <env>-qits-projects} client's, and
   * qits-idp mints that client {@code groups} of {@code qits:system}, {@code qits-platform:system}
   * and {@code clients/<id>} — no {@code project} claim, because the bootstrap grants one to exactly
   * two clients and this is neither. Demanding {@code project=*} therefore refused the route's only
   * sender on every call, and the loss was quiet twice over: the sender logs a non-2xx at debug
   * because the hop is best-effort (the release gate is correlated by merged sha and stays correct
   * without it), so what a supersession actually cost was a build agent, indefinitely.
   *
   * <p><b>The ordinary machine role is deliberately not enough.</b> A claim-less {@code qits:system}
   * client is refused here as it is on the trigger, and the reason is the same one: {@code
   * MachineAuth.requireClaim}'s rule that an absent claim is never a wildcard survives, and what
   * replaces it for a door asking "what may I do <em>for</em> you" is the other half of what qits-idp
   * issues. Widening to {@code qits:system} alone would have admitted the real caller too — the
   * cancellation is bounded, it stops the runs of one named release request in one named repository
   * and publishes no verdict — but it would also have made this the one door on the service where a
   * project-scoped client escapes its scope by simply not carrying it, which is the shape that
   * produced the bug being fixed. The platform-tier role is a grant somebody wrote down; the absence
   * of a claim is not.
