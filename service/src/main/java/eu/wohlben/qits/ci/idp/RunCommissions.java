/**
 * One commissioned credential per run, for as long as the run lasts.
 *
 * <p><b>Commissioned lazily, at the first step.</b> Every step first clones its repository from the
 * authenticated git host, so every step needs the pair. The Git credential helper exchanges it for
 * a short-lived githost bearer rather than ever putting the pair on the wire. Every later step of
 * the same run reuses it: the credential belongs to the run rather than to the step, and one
 * commission per step would be N clients to leak instead of one.
 *
 * <p><b>Given back at {@code runClosed}.</b> {@code CiDaemonStepRunner.runClosed} is called from a
 * {@code finally} on both run bodies, which is what makes the release unconditional. The paths that
 * never enter a run body — a supersede at accept, a {@code QUEUED} cancel, a row the boot sweep
 * failed — commissioned nothing in this process and have nothing to give back; what covers a
 * credential this process died holding is {@link CommissionReconciler}.
 *
 * <p><b>Memory, not a row.</b> A commission is worth exactly one run and a run does not survive this
 * process: a restart fails or re-enqueues every run it was holding, so a persisted pair would name a
 * credential no run will ever present. The reconciliation is the durable half, and it needs no
 * table of ours because qits-idp already holds the list.
