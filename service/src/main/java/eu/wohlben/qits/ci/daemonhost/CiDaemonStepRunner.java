/**
 * The sole implementation of the step seam: mint credentials → launch a container → wait for its
 * {@code qits-ci-daemon} to dial back and report its checkout done → answer with the step's script →
 * relay chunks while accumulating the bounded tail → wait for the terminal frame → reap → answer.
 *
 * <p><b>qits-ci executes nothing.</b> Nothing on this side ever runs a step's script: the script
 * leaves this process as a field of one JSON frame, on a socket the container's own daemon opened
 * outbound, and it executes as that daemon's child inside the sandbox. There is no {@code bash} and
 * no {@code exec} anywhere in this path — {@link CiDaemonLauncher} spawns no process at all, its
 * container vocabulary is lifecycle over HTTP, and its bootstrap is a constant with nothing
 * interpolated into it.
 *
 * <p><b>Every wait has a deadline, and each covers a different thing so a hang is attributable.</b>
 * Each pipeline occupies one run worker, so a wait that never returns permanently consumes one of
 * the configured build slots.
 * Register covers the image pull and the daemon download; initialize covers the daemon's own clone
 * and checkout; the step's own deadline is enforced <em>inside</em> the container and the wait here
 * sits a grace period behind it, so in the normal case the daemon reports its own timeout and the
 * host's backstop never fires. When it does fire, the daemon is not answering and the container is
 * cancelled and then removed.
 *
 * <p><b>Failure states stay distinguishable.</b> The orchestrator refusing the launch, a container
 * whose bootstrap never produced a daemon, a daemon that registered and then went quiet, a
 * structured setup failure, and a socket lost mid-step are five different things and each returns
 * its own {@link StepOutcome}. Where a container's own output is the only account of what happened —
 * a bootstrap that could not fetch the binary, above all — the removal itself brings the bounded
 * tail back ({@link CiDaemonLauncher#destroyWithLogs}), so the read-before-remove ordering is a
 * property of one call rather than of the order two are written in here.
