/**
 * The qits-idp commissioning client: one short-lived oidc client per CI run, minted on demand and
 * deleted when the run closes.
 *
 * <p><b>What replaced what.</b> A publishing step used to push with {@code
 * qits.ci.registry-auth.client-id}/{@code …client-secret} — one static credential, shared by every
 * run of every repository, living in a deployment's environment for as long as the deployment did.
 * qits-idp grew a commissioning API, so the credential a step holds is now this run's own: it exists
 * for the length of one pipeline, it is readable only by containers of that pipeline, and a leak
 * costs what one run could have done rather than what every run could.
 *
 * <p><b>Hand-rolled {@code java.net.http}, like every other client in this deployable.</b> The rule
 * is {@code AGENTS.md}'s native-image one — prefer what the image already has over a REST client
 * library — and the reading side is {@code readTree} plus a walk, so nothing here needs a reflection
 * registration either. The {@code HttpClient} is an instance field rather than a static one, for the
 * reason {@code HttpGitHostRepoListing} writes down: a static one is created at image-build time and
 * native-image refuses the heap it lands in.
 *
 * <p><b>The address is derived, never configured.</b> {@code quarkus.oidc-client.auth-server-url} is
 * already the idp base this service asks for its own machine token, and {@code /api/clients} is the
 * commissioning surface under it. A second key would be a second thing to keep in step with the
 * first, and a deployment that pointed the two at different idps would mint credentials one issuer
 * knows and present tokens another signed.
 *
 * <p><b>The caller is the service's own oidc client, and only a real one may commission.</b> The
 * request carries HTTP Basic of {@code quarkus.oidc-client.client-id} and {@code
 * quarkus.oidc-client.credentials.secret}; qits-idp answers 401 to an unknown pair and 403 when a
 * commissioned client tries to commission again, which is what keeps the tree one level deep.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #enabled()} is the fallback arm.</b> With {@code
 * quarkus.oidc-client.client-enabled} off — the shipped posture, and every test's — there is no
 * credential to present and nothing to commission with, so this class does nothing at all and a
 * step container's environment is byte-identical to what it was before any of this existed.
