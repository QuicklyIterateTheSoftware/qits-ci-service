/**
 * The bus end of the release join: consumes {@code SCMRelease} and records that a {@code
 * (repository, version)} really was released, then makes whatever announcements that unblocks.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this listener exists at all.</b> qits-ci used to announce a {@code SoftwareRelease} for
 * every green release-recipe run whatever triggered it, so a bootstrap replay — which restores a
 * release tag and nothing else — impersonated a release and woke the train against a half-deployed
 * platform. Only qits-workspaces publishes {@code SCMRelease}, and only a real release produces one,
 * so this is the fact that tells the two apart. {@link ReleaseJoin} is the rule; this bean is the
 * arrival.
 *
 * <p>It is the same shape as the three listeners beside it and adapts inward like {@code
 * CiEventTriggerListener} does: an {@link EventFrame} becomes five plain strings and an instant, so
 * the {@code ci} module keeps importing no publish/subscribe type.
 *
 * <h2>What it reads, and why by name</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code repository}, {@code repositoryName}, {@code version} and {@code priority} are read out of
 * the payload with a {@code readTree} walk, the trigger engine's own precedent — no binding, so no native-image
 * reflection metadata and no dependency on qits-workspaces' vocabulary jar, which is on neither
 * module's classpath here. That is also the one guard this path does not have: unlike {@code
 * SCMPublishTag}, whose field names {@code ScmPublishTagContractTest} resolves against the real
 * record, a rename over there would stop the join closing rather than fail a build here.
 *
 * <h2>Inline, in the claiming transaction</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #onFrame} runs on the bus's websocket worker or on the catch-up sweeper's thread, and
 * the fact row is written there — it is the effect the claim is a claim <em>of</em>, and handing it
 * to a queue would commit the claim for work that had not happened. The announcements it unblocks
 * are published from the same call, which means a bus publish on the dispatch thread. That is
 * bounded by the publish timeout and it is the honest place for it: an unreachable qits-events is
 * also the reason no frame would be arriving on this thread.
 *
 * <h2>Failure: what is retried and what is swallowed</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Retryable, and left to throw:</b> anything the join raises out of its own database work. A
 * store that is down is a condition rather than a verdict, so the claim rolls back and the event
 * stays owed for the next sweep — which is exactly right here, because a lost {@code SCMRelease} is
 * a release the platform never hears about.
 *
 * <p><b>Poison, and swallowed with a WARN:</b> a payload that will not parse, and one carrying no
 * repository or no version. Neither can succeed on a later offer — the same bytes fail identically
 * every time — and a throw would hold this consumer's watermark behind one bad event forever. A
 * frame with no {@code occurredAt} is <b>not</b> poison: the join orders nothing by it, so the
 * frame's absence costs the row a timestamp and never the fact, and the seen-at stamp is this
 * instance's own.
