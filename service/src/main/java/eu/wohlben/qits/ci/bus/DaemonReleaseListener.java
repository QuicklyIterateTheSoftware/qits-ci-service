/**
 * The bus end of the daemon pin ladder (ci-daemon-autoadopt-plan.md, workstream BX): consumes
 * {@code SoftwareRelease}, adopts the ones that name {@code qits-ci-daemon}, and seeds the ladder
 * at startup from what a restart missed.
 *
 * <h2>The frame, not the typed object -- measured rather than assumed</h2>
 *
 * <p>The plan's §2.8 calls this a {@code QitsEventListener<SoftwareRelease>}. It cannot be one and
 * still work: {@code CanonicalJson}'s mix-in hides every method {@link
 * eu.wohlben.qits.eventstream.QitsEvent} declares, by <b>signature</b>, from every implementation
 * uniformly -- and unlike {@code BuildSuccessful} (whose payload timestamp is the differently-named
 * {@code finishedAt}, with {@code occurredAt()} overridden to forward to it), {@link
 * SoftwareRelease#occurredAt()} <b>is</b> the interface method, so it is excluded from the payload
 * exactly like {@code eventId}. A typed listener's {@code onEvent} therefore receives a {@code
 * SoftwareRelease} rebuilt from the payload alone: {@code eventId} is fresh and unrelated to the id
 * qits-events actually stored, and {@code occurredAt} is bluntly {@code null} -- measured by running
 * exactly that path in this suite before writing this class, where it threw {@code
 * CiDaemonPins.adopt}'s own {@code IllegalArgumentException("occurredAt is required")}. Both are
 * exactly what {@link CiDaemonPins#adopt} needs: the real event id, for the idempotency key a
 * redelivery relies on, and the real {@code occurredAt}, for the freshness ordering that keeps a
 * late-delivered older release from being treated as a demotion (§2.6). Neither is recoverable from
 * the typed object.
 *
 * <p>{@link EventFrame} carries both, verbatim, because it <b>is</b> the envelope -- which is what
 * every seam but the typed one hands over.
 *
 * <h2>Durable, and the freshness guard is what makes that safe</h2>
 *
 * <p>This was a {@code QitsRawEventListener}: live-only, so a daemon release published while this
 * process was down was never adopted at all, and the only cure was {@link #reconcileFromLog}'s
 * startup read. As a {@link QitsDurableEventListener} the catch-up sweep covers that window
 * generally, and one event is adopted exactly once whatever mix of live frame, catch-up row and
 * startup reconciliation produced the arrivals.
 *
 * <p><b>Catch-up delivers late and out of order, and this ladder is last-writer-wins</b>, so the tip
 * check the seam demands is not optional here -- adopting a release that is older than the one
 * already pinned would roll the daemon backwards. It is already written and now load-bearing:
 * {@link CiDaemonPins#adopt} refuses any candidate whose {@code occurredAt} is not after the newest
 * adopted one (§2.6), and refuses a second adoption of the same event id. Both were written for a
 * redelivery on the live stream; both are exactly what a minutes-old caught-up frame needs.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the trigger engine, this listener's interest <em>is</em> knowable at startup -- one event
 * name -- so {@link #signatures()} names it, and {@link #selects} narrows further to the one daemon
 * this ladder adopts for. That narrowing is a pure read of the payload, which is what the seam asks
 * of a predicate, and it is what keeps the claim ledger holding daemon releases rather than every
 * {@code SoftwareRelease} the platform has ever published.
 *
 * <h2>Adoption is inline; only the probe owns a thread</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #onFrame} runs inside the claiming transaction, on the bus's websocket worker or on the
 * sweeper's thread. Adoption is a fast upsert and belongs there: it is the effect the claim is a
 * claim <em>of</em>, and enqueueing it would commit the claim for work that had not happened.
 *
 * <p>The probe cannot go there. {@link CiDaemonPins#answer()} may launch a container -- ten to thirty
 * seconds, mostly an image pull the first time -- and ci-daemon-autoadopt-plan.md §2.4 asks for it
 * asynchronously the moment a candidate lands, so {@code pinDaemon()} never pays for the first run's
 * probe. On the dispatch thread it would stall every other consumer, and inside the claiming
 * transaction it would hold a database connection across a container pull. Not {@code
 * ci-trigger-worker} either -- that thread's job is evaluating trigger files against candidate
 * repositories, an unrelated latency class, and sharing it would let a slow probe delay an
 * event-triggered build's own evaluation. A third single-threaded queue, sized like the trigger
 * engine's: bounded, so a burst costs a WARN naming the event rather than heap. A full queue is not a
 * failure of the adoption -- probing is lazy by design, so the next {@code answer()} does it.
 *
 * <h2>Failure: what is retried and what is swallowed</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Retryable, and left to throw:</b> anything {@link CiDaemonPins#adopt} raises out of its own
 * transaction. A database that is down is a condition, not a verdict, so the claim rolls back and the
 * event stays owed for the next sweep.
 *
 * <p><b>Poison, and swallowed with a WARN:</b> a payload that will not parse and a frame with no
 * {@code occurredAt}. Neither can succeed on a later offer -- they are the same bytes every time --
 * and a throw would hold this consumer's watermark behind one bad event forever. The unparseable
 * payload is answered in {@link #selects}, which settles it with no row at all; a missing {@code
 * occurredAt} is answered in {@link #onFrame}, because it is the one thing the ladder cannot order by.

   * is not that case: both belong in the table, as rung one and rung two, so the older of the two
   * has to land first.
   *
   * <p><b>Catch-up did not make this redundant, and the difference is the watermark.</b> A durable
   * consumer that has never run initializes at the <em>head</em> of the log and replays nothing --
   * consume-from-now, the seam's default and the right one. So a fresh deployment with an empty
   * ladder would sit on the configured pin until the next daemon release happened. This read is what
   * seeds the two rungs it should already have had. What the sweep owns instead is the ordinary case:
   * a process that has consumed before and was away for a while.

   * took is refused when the sweep or the stream offers it later.

   * <p>{@code onStart} itself fires once, automatically, before any test method runs -- exactly the
   * shape {@code CiRunService.onStart}/{@code sweepInterrupted} already carries, and the same fix:
   * the reconciliation is {@link #reconcileFromLog}, package-private, so a test that wants to claim
   * something about discovery seeds the log first and calls it directly.

   * blocks for {@code qits.ci.daemon-register-timeout-seconds} (180s, and 60s when this was
