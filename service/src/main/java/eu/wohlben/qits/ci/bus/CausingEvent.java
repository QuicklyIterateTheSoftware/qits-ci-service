 * Turns a run's recorded {@code triggerEventId} into the parent a publish is stamped with. One

 * a copy that will be made less defensive.
 *
 * <p><b>This is where the platform's automatic causation edge is drawn.</b> The id comes off the
 * run's own row rather than out of {@code CausationScope}, because there is no ambient value left to
 * read: the engine consumed the frame on the bus's dispatch thread and the publish happens later on
 * a runner's driver thread. An explicit non-null argument outranks the ambient context by design,
 * precisely for this case. A null passes through and publishes a root, which is what a historical
 * push row does — a push was not caused by an event.
