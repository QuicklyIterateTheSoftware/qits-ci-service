/**
 * The step container's own {@code qits-ci-daemon}, as a story drives it — and the tap for the one
 * plane the framework ships no tap for.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a real client and not a fixture</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link FakeCiDaemon} is a real Vert.x WebSocket dialling the real endpoint with the real
 * handshake headers and framing the real protocol through the vendored {@code CiDaemonCodec} — the
 * host cannot tell it from a container. What this class adds is the <b>credential's provenance</b>
 * and the <b>edges</b>. The id and the secret come out of the workload spec qits-ci sent a runner
 * in a {@code Launch} ({@link StoryRunner#awaitLaunch}), which is exactly where a container gets
 * them and the only place they exist: nothing in the story reads the host's launch
 * table, so an admitted dial here is evidence that the credential really travelled the way the
 * service says it does.
 *
 * <h2>The handshake carries two credentials, not one</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code CiDaemonSocket} is annotated {@code @RolesAllowed("qits:system")}, enforced at the HTTP
 * <b>upgrade</b>, so the container's per-launch secret is not on its own enough to get through the
 * door: the daemon also asserts {@code X-Qits-User: qits-ci-daemon} / {@code X-Qits-Roles:
 * qits:system}, which it may because the dial is intra-network and never crosses the edge that
 * strips that header namespace. {@link FakeCiDaemon} sends both pairs for that reason, and the two
 * do different jobs — the role opens the route, the secret says <em>which launch</em> this is, and
 * only the second one is checked against anything qits-ci minted.
 *
 * <h2>The tap, and why it is written here</h2>
 *
 * <p>The framework ships a RestAssured tap and nothing for a socket, so this plane is instrumented
 * with {@link NetworkCapture#observe} at the call sites — and every one of those calls is
 * synchronous on the <b>story thread</b>, which is the one place the framework's rule allows the
 * actor to be read. A handler on Vert.x' event loop would inherit whatever actor is current when
 * the frame lands, which is a different story's.
 *
 * <p>Two kinds, and the split is the vocabulary's own:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code socket}</b> — the dial. One edge, recorded once, for the connection the container
 *       holds open. Direction is who dialled, and the whole design of this plane is that the
 *       container dials <em>out</em>: qits-ci never dials in, which is why a step container needs
 *       no address and no inbound route.
 *   <li><b>{@code event}</b> — one per frame pushed over that connection, in whichever direction it
 *       was pushed. {@code hello}/{@code initialized}/{@code stepChunk}/{@code stepFinished} are
 *       the daemon's; {@code ack} and {@code runStep} are the host's, and {@code runStep} is the
 *       interesting one: <b>the step is the reply to the daemon's own {@code Initialized}</b>, so
 *       the arrow into the container exists only because the container asked for work.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Labels are the protocol's own type names plus values that cannot vary between runs (a
 * capability version, a stream name, an exit code). A correlation id is deliberately not in any of
 * them: it is minted per step and would move the story's {@code networkHash} on every run.
