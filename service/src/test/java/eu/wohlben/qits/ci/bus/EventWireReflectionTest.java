/**
 * Guards {@link EventWireReflection} — which is to say, guards the <em>completeness</em> of the
 * registration, because its correctness is not something this suite can reach.
 *
 * <p><b>Say plainly what a JVM test can and cannot prove here.</b> On a JVM every class reflects
 * whether anyone registered it or not, so nothing below would have failed on the build that shipped
 * the binary where publishing was dead — and nothing below would fail again if the annotation were
 * deleted tomorrow, except the assertions that read the annotation itself. Only the <b>native
 * artifact</b>, running, proves that the registration does its job; on this platform that proof is
 * the round trip through a real qits-events (a green build's {@code BuildSuccessful} arriving back
 * on {@code /events/stream} and being logged by {@link BuildSuccessfulListener}). What is written
 * here is the part that <em>is</em> checkable: that the set of registered types still covers every
 * type the wire path touches, and that the one entry named as a string still resolves. A test
 * pretending to more than that — "native reflection works" asserted in surefire — would pass
 * vacuously and be worse than none, which is the trap this file exists inside rather than above.
 * The repo's other native-only traps are documented the same way; see {@code AGENTS.md}.

   * want themselves, so the class each one binds to is not something a test can ask the bean for.
   * What it can ask is the name each one subscribes to, and the registration's own targets carry
   * those names: a signature is an event class's simple name, by the same derivation the typed seam
   * used.
   *
   * <p><b>Two exemptions, and both are "this listener binds nothing".</b> {@code "*"} is skipped
   * because a listener that wants everything promises to bind nothing in particular, and the trigger
   * engine really does read its payloads with {@code readTree}. {@link #WALKED} is the named form of
   * the same thing for a listener that wants one event it walks rather than binds — the rule this
   * test enforces is about binding, and a signature listed there is a claim that nothing on that path
