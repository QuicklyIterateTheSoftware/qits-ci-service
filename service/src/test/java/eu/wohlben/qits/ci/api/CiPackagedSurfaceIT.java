/**
 * The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b> — the fast-jar under a plain {@code mvn verify
 * -DskipITs=false}, and the GraalVM binary under {@code mvn verify -Dnative}. Every other test in
 * this repo runs in a JVM with the test classpath; this one starts the artifact a deployment
 * actually receives, which is the only way to catch the failure mode native-image has: reflection,
 * a classpath resource resolved by computed name, or a service loader that the closed-world build
 * dropped. Those leave the {@code @QuarkusTest} suite green and the binary broken at runtime.
 *
 * <p>So the assertions are chosen for what a native build can silently lose rather than for API
 * coverage (that is {@link CiPipelineBoundaryTest}'s job, and it stays the place to add behaviour):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the routes are where the config says — {@code quarkus.rest.path} and {@code
 *       quarkus.http.non-application-root-path} are <b>build-time</b> settings baked into the image,
 *       so a segment regression here can only be caught from the artifact;
 *   <li>the shipped datasource <b>expressions</b> resolve and connect. Both of them: this
 *       deployable's own {@code ci} store and the qits-eventstream jar's outbox, each reading a
 *       {@code QITS_RESOURCE_*} triple with no default behind it. The variables are what this IT
 *       supplies, never the datasource keys, so what is under test is the shipped file — which is
 *       where this repo's oldest native break lived (an {@code AUTO_SERVER=TRUE} that wanted H2's
 *       TCP server, a class the image does not contain) and where its container break lived too (a
 *       {@code ${user.home}} UID 1001 has no passwd entry for);
 *   <li>{@code db/ci/migration/V1__init.sql} survived as a resource and Flyway applied it — a
 *       migration is loaded by scanning a classpath location, exactly the shape native-image drops;
 *   <li>a real run reaches SnakeYAML and Panache: the intake queues, ci fetches the pushed commit
 *       with its own {@code git}, parses the committed config, and persists through Hibernate;
 *   <li>the ci-daemon control socket is on the artifact's router at {@code /ci/daemon} — a
 *       {@code @WebSocket} endpoint is registered by an extension at augmentation, so "websockets-next
 *       is native-image supported" is a claim this repo's rule says the binary has to prove rather
 *       than the documentation;
 *   <li>so is the runner control socket at {@code /ci/runners/socket}, the second endpoint of the
 *       same kind and owed the same proof;
 *   <li>and, for the same reason, <b>how the Angular client and the machine surface divide {@code
 *       /ci}</b>. Quinoa is disabled by default in test mode, so no {@code @QuarkusTest} in this repo
 *       has ever seen the client at all — the SPA fallback, the {@code <base href>} another
 *       repository's {@code angular.json} sets, and every path {@code
 *       quarkus.quinoa.ignored-path-prefixes} must keep out of it are provable here or nowhere.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>That last group is qits-events' probe list ({@code docs/project-setup-quinoa-angular.md}),
 * adopted here because the asymmetry was the risk: this repo asserted the document, the intake, the
 * socket and a whole push-to-run round trip, and never that {@code /ci/} serves a page. Shipping the
 * client's first real pages behind that gap is how the fallback trap gets discovered in production —
 * a mistyped machine path answered 200 {@code index.html}, which a machine client parses as data.
 *
 * <p>The pipeline it pushes declares <b>no steps</b> — a config-less push records nothing at all, so
 * an empty {@code steps} list is the smallest config that still records a run, and it takes the path
 * through the parser and the database without needing docker. Step execution needs a container and
 * belongs to {@code CiDaemonGateIT} (tagged {@code extended}, and excluded from the native build
 * for that reason — see the root pom).
