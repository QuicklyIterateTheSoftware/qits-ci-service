/**
 * A qits-events that never leaves this JVM: a real Vert.x server answering the real {@code PUT
 * /events/api/events/{id}} with a 201 and accepting a real upgrade on {@code /events/stream}, on an
 * ephemeral port handed to Quarkus as {@code qits.events.url} <b>before it boots</b> — which is the
 * only way a port that cannot be known earlier reaches the application's config. Same arrangement
 * (and same reason) as qits-gateway's {@code StubUpstream}.
 *
 * <p><b>A second, smaller copy of the eventstream module's stub, and deliberately so.</b> The two
 * modules do not share a test classpath — the same reason {@code FakeCiStepRunner} exists twice in
 * this repo — and publishing a test-jar to bridge them would couple this suite to that module's
 * fixtures for the sake of forty lines. This copy is trimmed to what an integration test needs: it
 * scripts nothing, always answers 201, and records what arrived. Failure handling, backoff and the
 * three-way PUT semantics are the eventstream suite's subject, not this one's.
 *
 * <p>The two literals below are the wire contract's, spelled out rather than imported: the
 * constants in the eventstream module are package-private, and a stub standing in for another
 * <em>service</em> should be written against the contract anyway. If they ever disagree, this
 * suite's PUT never arrives — which is exactly the failure a wrong path would cause in a
 * deployment.
