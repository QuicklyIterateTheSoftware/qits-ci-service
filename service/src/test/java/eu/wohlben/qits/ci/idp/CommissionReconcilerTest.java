 * The leftovers sweep: what qits-idp still holds, minus what a run still owns.
 *
 * <p>Driven through {@link CommissionReconciler#reap} with the run ids handed in, which is the seam
 * the boot pass and the schedule both reach through — the read behind them is one Panache query and
 * belongs to the run table's own tests. What is qits-ci's own here is the <b>predicate</b>: which
 * rows are this feature's, which are still owed, and what a listing nobody could read reaps.
