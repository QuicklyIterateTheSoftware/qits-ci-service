/**
 * The write surface with the machine gate ON — the deployment posture once qits-idp exists.
 *
 * <p><b>There are two guarded writes, and the second one is the interesting shape.</b> This file used
 * to cover the push intake, guarded with the pushed repository, and the manual trigger, guarded with
 * every project. The intake is gone — a push arrives as {@code SCMPublishCommit} off the event log,
 * where a bearer would mean nothing, since what authenticates an event is the bus that carried it
 * rather than a header on a request nobody makes. The cases that asked "may this token push to this
 * repository" have no endpoint left to ask it of.
 *
 * <p>What joined the trigger is {@code POST /ci/api/runs/cancellations}, qits-projects withdrawing a
 * release request's CI. <b>It has two real callers and both are asserted here</b>: a machine caller
 * is judged on its token exactly as the trigger's is, and an operator arrives on the edge's
 * forwarded {@code X-Qits-User}/{@code X-Qits-Roles} session carrying no token at all and is judged
 * by the class-level roles. That is why the {@code MachineAuth} call sits on the machine arm rather
 * than over the whole method, and why a case here asserts the forwarded session is <em>not</em>
 * answered 401 — a guard tightened to "always a token" would break the person, and one dropped
 * entirely would unguard the peer.
 *
 * <p><b>"Exactly as the trigger's is" is new, and it is the 2026-09-05 fix.</b> The cancellation
 * demanded {@code project=*} and its only real sender could not present one: qits-projects' bearer
 * for this hop is the {@code <env>-qits-projects} client's, minted with {@code qits:system}, {@code
 * qits-platform:system} and no structured claims at all, so every superseded release request's
 * cancellation was answered 403 and swallowed at debug by a hop that is best-effort on purpose.
 * {@link #theReleaseRequestCancellationAdmitsQitsProjectsOwnBearer} is that caller's exact shape and
 * is the case that must never go back to 403; the two beside it keep the widening where the ruling
 * put it.
 *
 * <p>{@code POST /ci/api/runs/{runId}/retry} is beside the cancel, in the other category: a person's
 * write, {@code qits:admin} only, and a machine granted every project is refused.
 *
 * <p>The rule they enforced is unchanged, and is why this file stays: a NEW write method that simply
 * omits {@code machineAuth.require*} ships unguarded and nothing says so. Add a write endpoint, add
 * its case here, and keep every address absolute — a moved prefix then shows up as a 404 rather than
 * as a pass.
 *
 * <p>The identity is installed by {@code @TestSecurity} rather than signed by a running idp on
 * purpose. What is under test is this service's decision about a token's claims; whether a signature
 * or an expiry is checked is quarkus-oidc's contract, tested where it lives. A test issuer here
 * would only re-assert the extension.
 *
 * <p><b>The reads are no longer open, and three doors now shut in order.</b> No token at all is a
 * 401. A token granted no roles is a 403 at {@code @RolesAllowed} — qits-platform-idp copies a
 * client's {@code roles} into the token's {@code groups} claim and quarkus-oidc reads that claim as
 * roles with no configuration at all, so a token minted without it authenticates and covers
 * nothing. Only then is {@code MachineAuth} asked, and a wrong audience or an uncovered project is
 * its own 403. Which caller each read serves is spelled out per case: the daemon pin takes the two
 * system roles a machine peer holds, and the run and repository reads take <b>the pair</b> —
 * {@code qits:system} is the machine role, {@code qits:admin} the human one, and both of those
 * callers legitimately read. What mutates is not widened with them: cancelling a run stays
 * {@code qits:admin} alone.
