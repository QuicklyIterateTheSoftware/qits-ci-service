/**
 * The two identity tracks qits-ci accepts, one helper each — because a story that presented the
 * wrong one would be documenting a door that does not exist.
 *
 * <h2>A machine is a bearer</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #platformService(RequestSpecification)} presents an RS256 token minted by {@link
 * MockIdp} against the very JWKS the launched process fetched at startup: {@code aud=qits-platform}
 * (what {@code qits.auth.machine.audience} pins), {@code groups=[qits:system]} — the machine role
 * quarkus-oidc reads as a role with no configuration — and {@code project=*}, which is what {@code
 * POST /ci/api/events/trigger} demands, since an event names no repository and the
 * repository-scoped grant it would otherwise need is "all of them".
 *
 * <h2>A person is a pair of headers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #operator(RequestSpecification)} sends {@code X-Qits-User} and {@code X-Qits-Roles}
 * instead, which is what the platform edge asserts for a logged-in human: this service
 * authenticates no person itself. That is not a shortcut around the bearer — the OIDC tenant is
 * <b>bearer-only</b>, so a request carrying no {@code Authorization} header is never challenged and
 * falls through to the header mechanism, exactly as it does behind the edge. Using it is what makes
 * the read stories say "an operator" honestly rather than dressing a person up as a machine.
 *
 * <p><b>The synthetic {@code dev} identity is not available here and that is the point.</b> The
 * forward-auth mechanism's fallback is {@code %dev}/{@code %test}-scoped <em>and</em> guarded on
 * {@code LaunchMode.NORMAL}; a launched artifact is under neither, so an anonymous request really
 * is anonymous and the roles below are the only thing opening these doors.
