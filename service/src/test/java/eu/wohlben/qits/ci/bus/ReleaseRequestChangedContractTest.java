/**
 * <b>The four strings a repository's QA pipeline is written against, checked against the wire form
 * they have to match.</b>
 *
 * <p>qits-projects maintains one backing branch per open release request — {@code release/<id>}, an
 * octopus merge of N sources — and publishes {@code ReleaseRequestChanged} on every successful
 * re-fold. That branch is written by the git host's merge primitive, which fires no {@code
 * post-receive} and therefore publishes no {@code SCMPublishCommit}: without this event the fold
 * exists and <b>nothing builds it</b>. So a repository's single QA pipeline selects this event and
 * checks the fold out:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * event: ReleaseRequestChanged
 * when:
 *   - repoName: { exact: <this repository> }
 * checkout:
 *   branch: backingBranch
 *   sha: mergedSha
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Four literals therefore have to agree with a record in another repository: the event NAME
 * ({@link CiRunService#RELEASE_REQUEST_EVENT_NAME}), the two checkout dot-paths, and the field the
 * run's {@code release_request_id} column is read out of ({@link
 * CiRunService#RELEASE_REQUEST_ID_FIELD}). Nothing in this service binds the payload — the trigger
 * engine subscribes to {@code "*"} and walks a {@code JsonNode} — so nothing but this file would
 * notice a rename.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is a transcription and not a resolution against the real record</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ScmPublishTagContractTest} resolves its two strings against the real {@code
 * SCMPublishTag}, because {@code qits-githost-events} is a dependency of this module. That move is
 * not available here for the reason {@code ScmReleaseContractTest} states at length about
 * qits-workspaces: <b>qits-projects publishes no vocabulary jar</b>, deliberately and by its own
 * ruling — a jar the platform's Maven registry does not serve resolves from a developer's {@code
 * ~/.m2} and fails inside a release pipeline's own step container, which is a red release rather
 * than a guard. That repository's own note says the field list below "is the contract qits-ci builds
 * its local record against"; this is that record.
 *
 * <p>So the transcription below is the contract, and it is <b>not</b> a fixture of expected JSON:
 * the bytes are produced by {@link CanonicalJson}, the same serializer the real publisher runs the
 * real record through, so every rule about the wire form stays the library's. What a person keeps in
 * step is one list of component names.
 *
 * <p><b>Read that as the standing instruction it is:</b> a change to {@code
 * qits-projects-service/service/…/bus/ReleaseRequestChanged.java} is a change to this transcription,
 * in the same campaign. A rename that lands there and not here leaves this suite green and every
 * repository's release-request pipeline silently dead — which is the one failure this file cannot
 * prevent and is why it says so out loud.
