/**
 * <b>The gate.</b> The whole lifecycle, end to end, with nothing faked: a real push into a real bare,
 * the real intake, real containers from a real image each downloading a real daemon binary, real
 * chunks over a real socket, and the real read surface asserted from outside the process.
 *
 * <p>Everything else in this repository is docker-free, which means everything else is blind to the
 * things that only exist once a container is running: the bootstrap's shell, the image contract, the
 * route back to this JVM, the binary's linkage, whether a daemon really enforces a deadline, and
 * whether a step spraying megabytes really costs bounded memory. That list is exactly this class's
 * subject, and it is the only place a step's script is really executed at all — no fake anywhere in
 * this repo runs one.
 *
 * <p>Five cases, one per thing the phase is finished when it does:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a two-step pipeline through the intake, followed live mid-run and read back as terminal
 *       per-step rows with host-stamped timestamps afterwards — with a deliberately <b>noisy</b>
 *       step, because bounded memory under a chunk flood is a property with no other home;
 *   <li>a cancellation honored mid-step;
 *   <li>a per-step {@code timeout-seconds} recorded as timed out rather than as a failure;
 *   <li>an image that cannot satisfy the contract, so the never-registered state is the container's
 *       own log rather than a generic step failure;
 *   <li>a step declaring {@code docker: true} really reaching the host's daemon through the mounted
 *       socket, beside a step that declared nothing and really has none.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Run it with {@code -DskipITs=false}. It is tagged {@code extended} and the {@code native}
 * profile excludes that tag: a native build has to run its ITs to be worth anything, and this one
 * would fail it for reasons about a host's docker and networking rather than about the binary.
 *
 * <p><b>The host-networking assumption, and its caveat.</b> Containers reach this JVM through {@code
 * host.docker.internal} — for the binary download, for the clone, and for the control socket — and
 * the assumptions below cover docker, the image and the daemon binary but <em>not</em> that route
 * existing. On a host where a container cannot get back to the JVM (plain WSL2 with no compose stack
 * up) this fails rather than skips. That is a property of the IT; do not "fix" it by weakening the
 * assertions. {@code service/pom.xml} gives failsafe {@code -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true} for the
 * other half of the same hazard and it has to stay.
 *
 * <p><b>The daemon binary is a system property, not a fixture.</b> {@code
 * -Dqits.ci.daemon-binary=<path>} points at whatever qits-ci-daemon's native build produced; that
 * the url can point anywhere is exactly why it is env, so this gate never waits on a publish to
 * qits-artifacts. Without the property every case here skips.
 *
 * <p><b>It drives the injected beans, not hand-wired ones</b> — the production path is the subject.
 * Two consequences, both commented where they happen: the container-facing config is overridden
 * through a {@link QuarkusTestProfile} whose {@code getConfigOverrides()} starts the fixture first
 * (the served port has to exist before the app boots), and the one value that cannot be known even
 * then — the control-socket url, which carries this JVM's own test port — is written onto the
 * launcher through its CDI proxy in {@link #wireTheLauncherToThisJvm()}.
