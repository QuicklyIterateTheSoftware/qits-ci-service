/**
 * The four bus listeners as <b>durable</b> consumers: what the claim ledger settles, what stays
 * owed, and what a late arrival is allowed to do.
 *
 * <p>There were five until 2026-09-05. {@code ScmPublishCommitListener} — consumer {@code
 * ci-push-runs} — accepted one run per pushed branch ref, and its section here asserted the claim
 * that made a redelivered push one build rather than two. An ordinary push triggers nothing now, so
 * the listener is gone and so is the consumption: its {@code consumed_event} rows and its watermark
 * are simply left behind, the way {@code pd-build-succeeded} was in qits-platform-deployments.
 * SCMPublishCommit still reaches {@link CiEventTriggerListener}, which subscribes to everything, and
 * is claimed under {@code ci-event-triggers} like every other event on the bus.
 *
 * <p>Driven through {@link DurableFunnel} directly rather than over the socket, which is the same
 * choice {@code CiEventTriggerCausationTest} and {@code DaemonReleaseListenerTest} make one level up
 * — the arriving is somebody else's test. It also buys the one thing dispatch cannot give: the
 * funnel <em>answers</em>, so "handled once" and "still owed" are assertions rather than inferences
 * from a side effect. The funnel is also exactly what the catch-up sweeper calls, so a second offer
 * of one frame IS a sweep reading past an event the stream already delivered.
 *
 * <p>What is not asserted here is the paging, the watermark and the pruning. Those are the library's
 * and its suite holds them; a copy here would test qits-eventstream through qits-ci.
 *
 * <p>Reuses {@link BuildSuccessfulPublishTest.EventstreamOn} — the funnel is a no-op with the module
 * dark, by design — and declares nothing else, so this class shares the application {@code
 * DaemonReleaseListenerTest} already starts rather than costing a second Quarkus boot.
