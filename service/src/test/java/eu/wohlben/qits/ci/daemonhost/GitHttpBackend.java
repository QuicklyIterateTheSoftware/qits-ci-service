/**
 * The half of a docker-backed gate that stands in for qits-artifacts: a git host over <b>smart</b>
 * HTTP at {@code /git/<repoId>}, and the daemon binary at {@code /qits-ci-daemon}, on one port a
 * step container can reach.
 *
 * <p><b>Why smart HTTP and not static files.</b> The daemon clones with {@code --depth 50}, and a
 * shallow clone is a capability only the smart transport advertises — a static-file handler gets
 * exactly as far as {@code fatal: dumb http transport does not support shallow capabilities}. That
 * would be the fixture being unrepresentative, not the daemon being wrong: depth 50 is deliberate (a
 * recent-but-not-tip sha must still be in the clone) and production qits-artifacts serves smart HTTP
 * at {@code /git/<repoId>}. So this shells {@code git http-backend} as CGI, which is what
 * qits-artifacts is doing behind its own route.
 *
 * <p><b>What it reproduces and what it does not.</b> Reproduced: the wire protocol, the url shape
 * ({@code <base>/git/<repoId>}, with ci appending the {@code /git} segment itself), ref
 * advertisement, and shallow negotiation — everything a daemon's clone actually exercises. Not
 * reproduced: qits-artifacts' authorization, its repository lookup, or any of its own routing; this
 * exports one directory unconditionally. That is the right split for a gate about the step
 * lifecycle, and assertions about what the git host does belong in qits-artifacts.
 *
 * <p>Shared by both docker-backed ITs in this package rather than copied into each: the CGI
 * plumbing below is fiddly enough that two copies would drift, and neither IT has anything of its
 * own to say about it.

   * Block until a container can actually open a TCP connection to each of this JVM's freshly-bound

   *
   * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> Docker's host-gateway forwarding does not pick up a listener the
   * instant it binds — measured on one host, a container launched immediately after {@code listen()}
   * returns gets {@code Connection refused}, and the very next attempt two seconds later downloads
   * all 45MB. The step container's bootstrap fetched <em>once</em> and exited when it could not, so
   * losing that race did not look like a race: the container was dead within a second and the host
   * then waited out its full register deadline, reporting {@code wget could not fetch} minutes
   * later. That reads like a broken bootstrap or a bad url, and it is neither.
   *
   * <p><b>This guard is still the right place for THIS fact, even though {@code BOOTSTRAP} now
   * retries.</b> The paragraph that used to stand here argued the fix belonged in the fixture
   * because "production ports belong to long-lived services", and that premise turned out to be
   * false about one service: qits-artifacts serves the daemon binary and deploys {@code stop-first},
   * so it refuses connections for a window on every deploy, and on 2026-09-15 a step container lost
   * exactly that race in production. {@code BOOTSTRAP} retries for that reason and not for this one.
   * What remains a fixture property is the <em>freshly bound</em> port: a listener this JVM stood up
   * a moment ago, which the retry would only paper over — and a host that can never route back
   * should say so here, in a minute, rather than after every case has failed for an apparently
   * unrelated reason.
   *
   * <p>It doubles as the honest form of the host-networking caveat both ITs carry: on a host where a
   * container genuinely cannot route back to the JVM, this fails in a minute saying so, instead of
   * every case failing later for an apparently unrelated reason.
