/**
 * What the step runner does with the orchestrator's answers, end to end through the real runner
 * against a scripted {@link StubContainersServer}.
 *
 * <p><b>Three claims, and each of them used to be two docker calls in a particular order.</b> A
 * refused create is recorded as the step never having run; a container that never initialized has
 * its log captured by the very call that removes it; and the unconditional reap in the {@code
 * finally} tolerates finding nothing, which is what lets it stay unconditional after a branch has
 * already removed the container.
 *
 * <p><b>The registry is a subclass rather than a mock, and the launcher is the real one.</b> What is
 * under test is the runner's wiring between the two, so the half that would need a websocket and a
 * real daemon is overridden and the half that speaks HTTP is left alone. No docker, no application,
 * no database.
