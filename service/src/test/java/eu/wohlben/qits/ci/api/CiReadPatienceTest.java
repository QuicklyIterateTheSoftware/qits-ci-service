/**
 * <b>A read that loses its connection mid-flight is held and served; one whose database stays gone
 * is still a 500.</b>
 *
 * <p>The pool opens every connection through {@code PatientPgDriver}, so a request that has executed
 * nothing waits for postgres to come back. This is the other half — a connection severed <i>after</i>
 * the statements ran, which no patience at creation time can undo — and it is why the caller-facing
 * reads in {@code CiRunService} are wrapped in {@code DbRetry}. The incident shape is a postgres
 * cutover mid-poll: qits-spa-ci polls {@code /ci/api/runs/active} every few seconds, which is
 * exactly where a severed pool is most likely to be found.
 *
 * <p><b>There were two surfaces here and now there is one.</b> {@code GET /ci/api/daemon} and the
 * daemon readiness check read the pin ladder's table on the container healthcheck's own cadence, so
 * a cutover found them mid-read more often than anything else — and that case had its own fake
 * repository and its own case in this class. The ladder is retired: {@code CiDaemonPins} reads two
 * constants and trims a config string, touching no database at all, so there is no connection there
 * left to sever. A retry that cannot be exercised is not a retry worth asserting.
 *
 * <p><b>Patience precedes the honest failure; it does not replace it.</b> What is under the deadline
 * is served, what outlives it is a 500, and the second case is here so the first cannot pass by
 * catching failures.
 *
 * <p>The fault is installed as a {@link QuarkusMock} over the Panache repository, the one bean
 * between the service and the database. Mocking it rather than breaking the datasource keeps the
 * fault to a single test: a datasource that cannot connect would take the whole process with it. The
 * deadline is shortened for the suite (see {@code src/test/resources/application.properties}), so the
 * give-up case does not wait out a production cutover.
