/**
 * A ci-daemon that never leaves this JVM: a real Vert.x WebSocket client dialling the real endpoint
 * with the real handshake headers, framing the real protocol messages the same way the native binary
 * does — {@code new JsonObject(CiDaemonCodec.encode(m))} out, {@code CiDaemonCodec.decode(json)} in.
 * The host cannot tell it from a container, which is the point: {@link CiDaemonSocket} and {@link
 * CiDaemonRegistry} are provable in a docker-free suite, and only {@code CiDaemonHandshakeIT} needs
 * a published binary.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately dumb — it holds no state machine and answers nothing on its own. Each test scripts
 * the frames it wants, including the wrong ones, which is how the refused dials and the malformed
 * frame are testable at all.
 *
 * <p><b>The handshake carries FOUR headers, not two, and the pair that is easy to forget is the one
 * that gets past the door.</b> {@link CiDaemonSocket} is annotated {@code
 * @RolesAllowed("qits:system")}, which quarkus-websockets-next enforces at the HTTP <em>upgrade</em>
 * — so a dial with no identity is answered <b>401 and never reaches {@code @OnOpen} at all</b>. The
 * real binary asserts the pair itself ({@code ControlSocket.connect}: {@code X-Qits-User:
 * qits-ci-daemon}, {@code X-Qits-Roles: qits:system}), which it may because the dial is
 * intra-network and never crosses the edge that strips the {@code X-Qits-*} namespace.
 *
 * <p>Measured 2026-08-29 against a <b>deployed</b> qits-ci: a raw upgrade carrying only the two
 * ci-daemon headers comes back {@code HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized}. In a {@code @QuarkusTest} it does
 * not, because the forward-auth mechanism's {@code %test} synthetic {@code dev} identity already
 * holds {@code qits:system} — so this omission was invisible to every suite that runs in TEST mode
 * and cost a packaged story its socket. That is exactly the class of gap a launched-artifact test
 * exists to close, and it is why the pair is spelled here rather than at one call site.
