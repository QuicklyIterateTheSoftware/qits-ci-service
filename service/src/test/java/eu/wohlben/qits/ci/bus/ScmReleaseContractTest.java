/**
 * <b>The four strings the release join is written against, checked against the wire form they have
 * to match.</b>
 *
 * <p>{@code ReleaseJoin} recognises a release by NAME and reads its key out of three payload FIELDS,
 * and all four are literals: {@code ci} depends on no other context's jar, deliberately, and
 * {@code ScmReleaseListener} walks the payload with {@code readTree} rather than binding it. That is
 * the right split and it leaves exactly one thing to go wrong: the publisher renames the event or a
 * field, this service compiles, and the join silently stops closing — every release would then
 * publish without announcing, which reads exactly like a train that quietly did not roll.
 *
 * <h2>The publisher moved and this file did not have to</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code SCMRelease} is published by <b>qits-projects</b> now, not by qits-workspaces: the release
 * flow's rearchitecture puts the release request — its sources, its backing branch, its tag — in
 * qits-projects, and the announcement belongs to whoever creates the tag. The event's shape did not
 * move with it. Same signature, same components, same payload fields, so the transcription below was
 * unchanged and every consuming line in this service was unchanged with it. What has grown since is
 * additive and is listed below.
 *
 * <h2>The fields that HAVE been added since, and why this file is where you find out</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>{@code commitSha}</b> — what the tag points at. It is the standing instruction below being
 * carried out for the first time: qits-projects grew the component, so this transcription grew it
 * in the same campaign, and this repository's own {@code .config/qits/ci-event-release.yml} spends
 * it on a {@code checkout:} so a release run is anchored at the released tag instead of at {@code
 * main}. Strictly additive — the five original fields keep their names, their types and their order,
 * and the new one is omitted from the payload when it is absent — so nothing that reads the old
 * shape had to change, and the pipeline that reads the new one has a fallback for the old.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code priority}</b> — the release request's effective priority, folded in qits-projects out
 * of the priorities declared on its participating branches. The same instruction carried out a second
 * time, appended last after {@code occurredAt} and nullable for the same reason, and it is the field
 * this service is most nearly indifferent to: {@code ScmReleaseListener} reads it, {@code
 * ReleaseJoin} records it on the fact row and hands it to {@code SoftwareRelease}, and <b>nothing in
 * between compares it to anything</b> — no enum, no queue ordering, no gate. So a rename over there
 * costs this transcription and the value on the outgoing event, and costs the join and the build
 * nothing at all. It is transcribed anyway, because a field carried verbatim is still a field two
 * repositories have to spell the same way.
 *
 * <p><b>That nothing had to change is the finding, and it is a property of how this consumer is
 * written rather than luck.</b> Nothing here keys on the producer: the durable seam subscribes by
 * SIGNATURE, {@code EventFrame} carries no publisher and no source service, {@code ReleaseJoin}'s key
 * is {@code (repository, version)}, and the causation chain is the frame's own id rather than an
 * expectation about which service minted it. A consumer that had recorded "qits-workspaces said so"
 * anywhere — a producer filter, a source-service check, an expected parent — would have gone silently
 * dead on the cutover, in the direction that publishes without announcing.
 *
 * <p><b>What DID change is one value, and this file pins it too</b> — see {@link
 * #aReleaseCutFromABackingBranchIsTheSameContract}. {@code branch} used to be a source branch that
 * still existed; it is now {@code release/<requestId>}, the request's backing branch, and that branch
 * is <em>deleted</em> at tag creation. No field this service reads is affected, which is the whole
 * assertion.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not {@link ScmPublishTagContractTest}'s mechanism</h2>
 *
 * <p>That test resolves its two strings against the real {@code SCMPublishTag}, because
 * {@code qits-githost-events} is a dependency of this module. The same move is not available here
 * and the reason is not a preference: <b>neither publisher of this event ships a vocabulary jar.</b>
 * Measured on 2026-08-12 against the platform Maven registry — it serves {@code qits-githost-events}
 * and {@code qits-eventstream} and answers {@code nothing is deployed} for
 * {@code eu/wohlben/qits/qits-workspaces-events}. qits-projects, which publishes it now, is the same
 * answer by its own ruling: its one published event lives in its {@code service/…/bus/} package and a
 * consumer decodes it into a local record, which is this platform's standing pattern. A dependency on
 * either would compile here from a developer's {@code ~/.m2} and fail to resolve in the release
 * pipeline's own step container, which is a red release rather than a guard.
 *
 * <h2>So the TRANSCRIPTION below is the contract, and this file is where it is kept</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link SCMRelease} is a hand-kept copy of the component list of
 * {@code services/qits-workspaces/workspaces-events/src/main/java/eu/wohlben/qits/workspaces/events/SCMRelease.java},
 * the record {@code services/qits-workspaces/service/…/bus/SCMReleaseAnnouncer.java} publishes. It
 * is <b>not</b> a fixture of expected JSON: the bytes are produced here by {@link CanonicalJson},
 * the same serializer the real publisher runs the real record through, so every rule about the wire
 * form — alphabetical keys, and the {@code QitsEvent} accessors the mix-in hides — stays the
 * library's rather than something this file guessed. What a person has to keep in step is one list
 * of component names, and that is the smallest honest surface for a contract two repositories share
 * and no jar carries.
 *
 * <p><b>Read that as the standing instruction it is:</b> a change to that record in qits-workspaces
 * is a change to this transcription, in the same campaign. A rename that lands there and not here
 * leaves this suite green and the join dead — which is the one failure this file cannot prevent and
 * is why it says so out loud.
 *
 * <p>The canonical bytes this produces are also what {@link DurableBusConsumptionTest} drives
 * through the real listener, so the strings are proved to work end to end rather than merely to be
 * present.
