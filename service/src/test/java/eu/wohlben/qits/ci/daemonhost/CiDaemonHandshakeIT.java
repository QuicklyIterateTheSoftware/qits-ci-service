/**
 * <b>The phase-B gate.</b> Everything the docker-free suite proves against {@link FakeCiDaemon}, once
 * more against a real container: a real image, a real download of a real daemon binary, a real dial
 * back over the network, and a real step whose output arrives as chunks. It is the only test here
 * that can fail for a reason the in-JVM suite structurally cannot see — the bootstrap's shell, the
 * image contract, the container's route back to the host, the binary's own linkage.
 *
 * <p>Run it with {@code -DskipITs=false}. It is tagged {@code extended} and the {@code native}
 * profile excludes that tag, as it does for every docker-backed IT here: a native build has to run
 * its ITs to be worth anything, and this one would fail it for reasons about a host's docker and
 * networking rather than about the binary.
 *
 * <p><b>The host-networking assumption every docker-backed IT here carries, and its caveat.</b>
 * The container reaches this JVM through {@code host.docker.internal} on {@code qits.ci.network} —
 * twice over, for the binary download and for the control socket — and the JUnit assumptions below
 * cover docker, the image and the daemon binary but <em>not</em> that route existing. On a host where
 * a container cannot get back to the JVM (plain WSL2 with no compose stack up) this fails rather than
 * skips. That is a property of the IT — do not "fix" it by weakening the assertions.
 *
 * <p><b>One half of that hazard is now handled and must stay handled:</b> a JVM left to itself binds
 * a dual-stack IPv6 socket for {@code 0.0.0.0}, which docker's host gateway does not forward, so
 * every listener this test stands up is invisible from the container. It does not fail as a
 * connection error either — it fails as the register deadline expiring with {@code wget could not
 * fetch} in the container's log, which reads like a broken bootstrap and costs an afternoon. {@code
 * service/pom.xml} gives failsafe {@code -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true} for exactly this; it has
 * to be an {@code argLine} because the JVM reads it when networking initialises, before any test
 * runs. Delete it and this test regresses to a two-minute timeout with a misleading message.
 *
 * <p><b>The daemon binary is a system property, not a fixture.</b> {@code -Dqits.ci.daemon-binary=
 * <path>} points at whatever qits-ci-daemon's native build produced; the IT serves that file over
 * HTTP and hands its url to the container as {@code $QITS_CI_DAEMON_BINARY_URL}. That the url can
 * point anywhere is exactly why it is env — a file-served stand-in is indistinguishable from
 * qits-artifacts here, so this gate never waits on a publish. Without the property the two
 * binary-dependent cases skip; {@link #aContainerThatNeverRegistersIsReapedWithItsOwnLogCaptured}
 * does not need one and runs on docker alone.
 *
 * <p>The image is pinned to {@code buildpack-deps:scm}, verified to carry {@code git}, {@code bash},
 * {@code wget} and {@code curl} — the whole image contract, with both downloader arms present.
 *
 * <p><b>It needs a running qits-containers now, and that is one more precondition rather than a new
 * kind of one.</b> qits-ci starts no container itself; the orchestrator does. The harness recipe is
 * one command — run the {@code qits/containers} image with the host's docker socket and this
 * network, then point {@code -Dqits.containers.url=http://127.0.0.1:<port>} at it:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   docker run -d --name qits-containers-it --network qits-net -p 18080:8080 \
 *     -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock qits/containers:latest
 *   ./mvnw verify -DskipITs=false -Dqits.containers.url=http://127.0.0.1:18080 \
 *     -Dqits.ci.daemon-binary=&lt;path&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * Absent one, these cases <b>skip</b> rather than fail: an orchestrator is infrastructure this
 * repository does not run, exactly like the daemon binary, and the clone-alone rule is what makes
 * that the right answer. The host-networking caveat above is the deliberate exception and stays one.
