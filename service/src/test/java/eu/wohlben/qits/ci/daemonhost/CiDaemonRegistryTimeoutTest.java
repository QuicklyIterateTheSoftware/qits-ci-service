/**

 *
 * <p>The single-threaded run worker used to park on a process; it now parks on a socket. Same
 * blocking discipline, new failure mode: a future that never completes would wedge <b>all</b> of CI,
 * not just its own run. So every await in {@code daemonhost} carries its transition's timeout, and
 * this holds that two ways — behaviourally, that each of the three awaits returns by its deadline
 * with nothing on the other end; and structurally, that no second, untimed wait was added later.
 *
 * <p>Plain JUnit rather than {@code @QuarkusTest}: nothing here needs a socket, and it keeps the
 * test out of the port race the repo's known flake lives in.

   * The structural half: grep the package for a wait with no deadline on it. A behavioural test can
   * only prove the awaits that exist today are bounded — this is what stops a fourth one from being
   * added untimed next year, and it is cheap enough to be worth the unusual shape.
   *
   * <p><b>The {@code …AndAwait} family is banned by shape rather than by name</b>, and that
   * generalisation was bought the hard way. The pattern first listed {@code sendTextAndAwait} and
   * {@code sendBinaryAndAwait} explicitly, on the correct reasoning that each is
   * {@code sendText(m).await().indefinitely()} — and then sat green over two live calls to {@code
   * closeAndAwait}, which is the identical shape under a name nobody had thought to enumerate. The
   * untimed part of these lives inside the framework's default method, so it never appears in this
   * package's own source and only the <em>call</em> is visible here. Any convenience the extension
   * spells that way is one this package must not take: give the bounded form instead —
   * {@code close(…).await().atMost(…)}, {@code sendText(m).await().atMost(…)}.
   *
   * <p>The one thing the shape rule cannot catch is a wait added through some future spelling that
   * looks like neither. That is what the class javadoc on {@code CiDaemonRegistry} is for, and why
   * this test's failure message says what to do rather than only that something is wrong.
