/**
 * Two facts about the shipped configuration that would otherwise only be discovered by their
 * consequences, and one of them silently.
 *
 * <p><b>The bus is dark in the suite.</b> Every other test class here runs on the default test
 * config, and this asserts what that means: the switch is off and no stream was dialled. The way it
 * fails without this test is not a failure — it is a suite that quietly spends a publish timeout per
 * green run against an unresolvable host and keeps redialling a websocket, which reads as slowness
 * rather than as misconfiguration. {@code BuildSuccessfulPublishTest} is the one class that opts
 * back in, and it does so against a stub.
 *
 * <p><b>The listener beans survive ArC.</b> They are reached only through {@code
 * Instance<QitsDurableEventListener>} — no name, no channel — and unused-bean removal would leave a
 * deployment that subscribes to nothing, receives nothing, sweeps nothing and says nothing about it.
 * An {@code Instance} injection point counts as a use, which is why no {@code @Unremovable} is
 * needed; this is the assertion that keeps that true rather than believed. It matters most for
 * {@link CiEventTriggerListener}: removed, this service still serves every read and simply never
 * runs anything again. {@code ScmReleaseListener} is the same class of silence one step along —
 * removed, no release fact is ever recorded and every release publishes without announcing.
 *
 * <p><b>And their consumer ids are asserted here because they are storage.</b> Each one keys a
 * {@code consumed_event} ledger and a {@code consumer_watermark}; changing one silently mints a
 * brand-new consumer that initializes at the head of the log and skips everything in between, and
 * reusing one hands a listener another's claims. A literal in this test is what makes either show up
 * as a red build rather than as a quiet gap in what was consumed.
 *
 * <p><b>And one of the five asks to be initialized at the EPOCH</b>, which is the other half of the
 * same storage fact and is asserted here beside the ids. {@code replayFromEpoch} is consulted once, at
 * the moment a consumer id first gets a watermark, and never again — so it is not a setting that can
 * be corrected later, and the difference between the two answers is the whole history of an event or
 * none of it.
 *
 * <p><b>There were five before that, and {@code ci-push-runs} retired with per-push CI on
 * 2026-09-05.</b> Its
 * {@code consumed_event} rows and its watermark are left where they are rather than migrated away —
 * a retired consumer id is abandoned, which is what qits-platform-deployments did with {@code
 * pd-build-succeeded} — and the id must never be handed to a new listener, which would inherit a
 * watermark saying it had already handled every push ever announced.
