/**
 * The one launched process, addressed the way each of its planes is addressed — and named the way a
 * diagram names it.
 *
 * <p>qits-ci serves <b>three</b> shapes on one port and a story has to know which is which, because
 * they authenticate differently and only two of them are a story's own traffic:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code /ci/api/…}</b> — the JSON API, under {@code quarkus.rest.path}. Every route on it
 *       carries a class-level role ({@code qits:admin} or {@code qits:system}), so a story presents
 *       an identity on every call: a machine bearer for the trigger, forward-auth headers for the
 *       reads. See {@link StoryIdentities}.
 *   <li><b>{@code /ci/daemon}</b> — the control socket, a {@code @WebSocket} literal that does
 *       <em>not</em> follow {@code quarkus.rest.path} and therefore spells the {@code /ci} segment
 *       itself. It is the string every step container's daemon dials verbatim
 *       (the path of every step's {@code $QITS_CI_DAEMON_URL}), which is why it is written here as an absolute
 *       literal rather than derived from anything.
 *   <li><b>{@code /ci/q/…}</b> — what Quarkus itself serves. The framework's RestAssured tap skips
 *       any path with a {@code /q/} segment, and this service's non-application root is
 *       {@code /ci/q}, so the shipped default is right here without an override.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The <b>port is random</b> — failsafe launches the artifact with {@code
 * quarkus.http.test-port=0} — so nothing here is a constant except the paths. RestAssured is
 * configured with the port by the Quarkus integration-test extension, so an API call needs no base
 * url at all; only the socket does, and {@link #daemonSocket()} builds it from
 * {@link RestAssured#port} for exactly that reason.
