/**
 * A push, as it arrives: one {@link EventFrame} carrying an {@link SCMPublishCommit} payload.
 *
 * <p>This is what every suite here used to build as a JSON body for {@code POST
 * /ci/api/events/post-receive}. The endpoint is gone, so a test drives {@code
 * ScmPublishCommitListener} instead — and the frame is built through {@link CanonicalJson} from a
 * <b>real</b> {@code SCMPublishCommit} rather than from a hand-written string, so what a test hands
 * the listener is byte for byte what qits-githost publishes. A field renamed on the record shows up
 * here as a compile error rather than as a suite that keeps passing against a payload nobody sends.
 *
 * <p>Shared across packages ({@code api} drives it too) rather than copied per test class, which is
 * the opposite of what this repo does with {@code FakeCiStepRunner} — those are duplicated because
 * the two MODULES do not share a test classpath, and everything here is one module.
