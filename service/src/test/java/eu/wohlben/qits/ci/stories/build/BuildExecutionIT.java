/**
 * <b>What actually runs a build step</b>, end to end, with nobody in it holding a docker socket.
 *
 * <p>The arrangement is the whole design of this service, and it is inside out on purpose:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A <b>runner</b> — a machine registered with qits-ci, holding {@code /ci/runners/socket}
 *       open — reserves the run, and qits-ci sends it a {@code Launch} for the step: the whole
 *       workload spec, whose environment carries a launch id minted for this one step and the
 *       run's own token. The runner's host starts that container with its own docker; this process holds no
 *       docker socket, spawns no process and calls no orchestrator (qits-506).
 *   <li>The container's own {@code qits-ci-daemon} <b>dials out</b> to {@code wss://…/ci/daemon},
 *       through the platform edge, presenting the run's token, and names its launch in its first
 *       frame. qits-ci never dials in, which is why a step container needs no address.
 *   <li>The daemon says {@code Initialized} once its checkout is done, and <b>the step is the reply
 *       to that</b>. The host initiates nothing: a script leaves this process as one field of one
 *       JSON frame, and executes as the daemon's child inside the sandbox.
 *   <li>Output comes back as {@code StepChunk} frames while the step runs, and one {@code
 *       StepFinished} ends it. qits-ci then sends the runner a {@code Reap} for the container, and
 *       a {@code Released} for the run.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>The daemon in this story is a real client of the real socket.</b> {@link StoryDaemon} is a
 * Vert.x WebSocket framing the vendored protocol exactly as the native binary does, and — the part
 * that makes this evidence rather than a fixture — it learns its credentials <b>only</b> from the
 * workload spec that reached {@link StoryRunner} in a {@code Launch}. Nothing here reads the host's
 * launch table. An admitted dial is therefore a measurement of the whole path: qits-ci commissioned
 * the run a token, minted the launch an id, put both in a container spec, sent it to the runner,
 * and then recognised the launch coming back off a socket as that token's subject.
 *
 * <p>What is <b>not</b> proved here, and is out of reach in this container: a real image, a real
 * daemon binary and a real docker daemon. The real daemon binary is {@code CiDaemonPinIT}'s; the
 * real {@code docker run} is the runner's own (qits-ci-runner-daemon). What this story adds is that
 * it needs none of it — so the flow is documented on every ordinary build.
 *
 * <p><b>Two stories, and the second is deliberately not the first one's tail.</b> The peer that
 * asked for the build polls the run it asked for, with the machine role, which is what
 * qits-platform-maintenance does while it waits out a bump. A <b>person</b> reading the transcript
 * afterwards is a different door, a different identity track and — the claim the diagram makes —
 * a walk that reaches no other service at all: the step's output is a row by then, so reading it
 * costs the git host nothing and the runner nothing.
