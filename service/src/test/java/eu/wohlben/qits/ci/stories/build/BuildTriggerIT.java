/**
 * <b>How a build starts.</b> Not a push — a push is an {@code SCMPublishCommit} off the event log
 * and there is no HTTP door to it — but the other trigger, which is the one this platform's release
 * train is built out of: a repository commits {@code .config/qits/ci-event-*.yml} naming a domain
 * event and a selection over its payload, and an arriving event runs that file's pipeline.
 *
 * <p>The event arrives through {@code POST /ci/api/events/trigger}, the second inbound adapter of
 * the same engine — a hand-supplied event, built into the same {@code Arrival} the bus builds, so
 * the engine cannot tell the two apart. It is the door a bootstrap replay knocks on, and it is the
 * only one a story can knock on without standing up a whole qits-events beside a launched artifact.
 *
 * <p><b>Two stories, and the second is what the first cannot say.</b> One event fires a pipeline;
 * one event that no repository selected fires nothing — and "fires nothing" is a claim about
 * absence that only the negative network assertions can make. {@code assertNoEdgesTo(a runner)} is
 * the interesting one: no repository matched, so no run was recorded, so no runner was handed
 * anything and nothing on this platform started a container. A presence check cannot say that.
 *
 * <p>Both pipelines declare <b>no steps</b>. That is the smallest configuration that still records a
 * run — a commit declaring nothing is discarded, which is what opt-in means — and it takes the whole
 * path through the git host, SnakeYAML, the queue, a runner's reservation and Panache with no
 * container involved: the runner takes the run and is released from it without a single {@code
 * Launch}. What a step costs, and what a step container's daemon does with it, is {@link
 * BuildExecutionIT}.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is <b>observed</b>: the framework's RestAssured tap draws what a story sent
 * into qits-ci, {@link StoryGitHost} draws what qits-ci read back out of the git host, and {@link
 * StoryRunner} draws the runner's socket — which would carry a {@code Launch} if a step container
 * were asked for. A story method asserts and
 * notes; it draws nothing.
