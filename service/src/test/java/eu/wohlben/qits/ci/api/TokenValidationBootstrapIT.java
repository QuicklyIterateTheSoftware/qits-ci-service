/**
 * The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b> — like {@link CiPackagedSurfaceIT} beside it, but with
 * the OIDC tenant <b>on</b>, which no {@code @QuarkusTest} here can prove. The shipped tenant is
 * gated: {@code quarkus.oidc.tenant-enabled=${qits.auth.machine.required:false}}, and every suite in
 * this repository leaves that gate shut — {@code MachineGuardTest} comes closest and stops exactly
 * where this one starts, because it flips the gate but installs its identity with
 * {@code @TestSecurity} + {@code @OidcSecurity} claims, so nothing there ever fetches a key or
 * validates a signature. The block this service actually deploys with (auth-server-url plus {@code
 * jwks-path=jwks} against a real listener, audience enforcement, the {@code groups} claim becoming
 * roles) is therefore exercised nowhere else. The far side is {@link MockIdp}, whose recordings make
 * the interaction assertable on <b>both ends</b>.
 *
 * <p>It is also this repo's <b>first</b> userflow — the rest of the catalogue is under {@code
 * …ci.stories}, where the build flows live: the proof doubles as documentation, emitted under
 * {@code target/userstories/} with a network diagram beside the steps. The diagram is <b>observed,
 * never narrated</b> — {@link NetworkTaps#restAssured} taps what a story sends into this service,
 * {@link MockIdp}'s recordings supply what this service sent to the idp, and the framework drains
 * both at story end. A story method therefore asserts and notes; it draws nothing. Both stories are
 * browserless (an {@code Interactions} parameter and no {@code Flow}), so the framework's transitive
 * Playwright never launches anything.
 *
 * <p><b>That tap used to be a copy in this repository.</b> {@code StoryNetworkFilter} sat beside
 * this class, twenty hand-copied lines naming this service and its probe root; the framework ships
 * it now, idempotent per service, so every story class installs the same one from its own {@code
 * @BeforeAll} and no repository has a private opinion about what a probe is.
 *
 * <p><b>The two stories are ordered</b>, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness: a cumulative
 * source is attributed by a cursor, so traffic that happened before any story ran — the startup JWKS
 * fetch, which is the whole subject of the first story — lands in whichever story drains
 * <i>first</i>. Pinning the order is what keeps that the story it belongs to.
 *
 * <p><b>The same argument reaches across classes, which is why this one runs first.</b> Its profile
 * is the one every story class in this repository shares — one {@code @TestProfile} is one launched
 * process for the whole failsafe phase — so they are a single group to Quarkus' profile-aware class
 * orderer and the secondary orderer breaks the tie by class name: {@code
 * …ci.api.TokenValidationBootstrapIT} sorts before {@code …ci.stories.*}. The story classes say so
 * explicitly with {@code @UserflowRunsAfter} as well, because a JWKS fetch drained into a build
 * story would empty the story it documents.
 *
 * <p><b>ITs stay skipped by default here and this one does NOT flip that.</b> {@code skipITs} is
 * {@code true} in the root pom because the three docker-backed gates — {@code CiDaemonHandshakeIT},
 * {@code CiDaemonGateIT}, {@code CiDaemonContainerProbeIT} — bind to the same failsafe run and need
 * real docker, a published step image, a built daemon binary and a container route back to this JVM.
 * The root pom's {@code qits.it.excluded-groups} would exclude them by their {@code extended} tag,
 * but it is <b>empty by default</b> and only the {@code native} profile sets it, deliberately, so
 * that {@code -DskipITs=false} still means "run everything". Naming the class is therefore the only
 * opt-in that is correct on a plain {@code verify}, and it is what {@code
 * .config/qits/ci-event-userflows.yml} passes:
 *
 * <pre>{@code ./mvnw verify -DskipITs=false -Dit.test=TokenValidationBootstrapIT}</pre>

   * <p><b>Every key below is a RUNTIME key.</b> A packaged process takes its configuration as
