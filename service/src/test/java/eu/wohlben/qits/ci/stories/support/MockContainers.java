/**
 * qits-containers, played by a recording stand-in — the service that owns the docker daemon, and
 * therefore the service a step container has to be asked for.
 *
 * <p><b>qits-ci holds no docker socket and spawns no process.</b> Putting a step container
 * somewhere is four HTTP calls to this address, and the only two a story sees are {@code
 * PUT …/{ref}} (start it) and {@code DELETE …/{ref}} (take it away). So a stand-in that answers
 * those two is the whole of what stands between a story and a real build — no docker, no image, no
 * published daemon binary.
 *
 * <h2>It is not a mock: it is where the step's credentials come from</h2>
 *
 * <p>The {@code PUT}'s body is the workload spec, and the spec's environment carries {@code
 * QITS_CI_DAEMON_ID} and {@code QITS_CI_DAEMON_SECRET} — the per-container credential qits-ci mints
 * for this one step and hands to nobody else. A real daemon reads them out of its own environment
 * and dials back with them. {@link #awaitLaunchEnvironment} reads them out of the recorded spec,
 * which is what lets {@link StoryDaemon} be a real client of the real socket rather than a
 * fixture with privileged access to the host's registry: the story learns the secret exactly the
 * way a container learns it, and by no other route.
 *
 * <p>{@code eu.wohlben.qits.servicemock.MockService} could not serve this. It records method, path,
 * query and status — everything a diagram needs and nothing a credential lives in — and the body is
 * the entire point here.
 *
 * <h2>The recording is a file, and the boot reap is not in it</h2>
 *
 * <p>Same arrangement, and the same reason, as {@link StoryGitHost}: this server is started from a
 * {@code QuarkusTestProfile}, which is instantiated in more than one classloader, so the port is
 * parked in a system property and the recording is a file both copies resolve identically.
 *
 * <p>{@link #installSource()} skips the one call that is nobody's story: qits-ci's boot reap, a
 * {@code DELETE} of the whole {@code (owner, workload)} collection that a {@code StartupEvent}
 * observer makes before any story exists. Every call a story causes addresses one place and carries
 * a {@code ref}, so the two are told apart by the shape of the path — the service's own
 * distinction, not one invented here.
